      "The U.S. government is scrambling to update thousands of computer systems and software programmes that might otherwise see January 1, 2000 as \"00\" and think they are operating in 1900.\n",
      "\"We are confident that all of the major systems will be fixed,\" said Sally Katzen, who is coordinating much of the repair effort from her post as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget.\n",
      "\"That is what we are setting out to do and that is what we will do,\" she pledged in an interview.\n",
      "Legislators in Congress have also taken an interest in the subject and prodded agencies into action. Most are well aware of the problem, congressional staff say, although a few slackers including the air traffic control system are raising concerns.\n",
      "\"Congress is sounding the alarm and will keep sounding it until this problem is solved,\" Representative Steve Horn told Reuters.\n",
      "Horn, chairman of the Government Reform Committee's Management, Information and Technology sub-committee, has taken testimony from a variety of government and private-sector experts on the year 2000 problem.\n",
      "\"I have learned that the real challenge it poses is to management,\" Horn said. \"Software experts are capable of fixing the problem but can management understand what is at stake, make it a priority, organise a plan and allocate resources so the technical experts can do their job?\"\n",
      "GOVERNMENT AGENCIES READY TO ADJUST FOR MILLENNIUM\n",
      "The sub-committee surveyed government agencies about year 2000 awareness last year and responses to an updated survey have just come in. The latest survey found that all agencies are aware of the problem and most are ready to put in place the needed fixes, a congressional staffer said.\n",
      "Some of the agencies that people are most concerned about, the Defence Department and the Social Security Administration, appear to be in good shape and have extensive plans to fix the problem well before December 31, 1999.\n",
      "At the Defence Department, \"we are treating it much as we would a computer virus,\" Assistant Secretary of Defence Emmett Paige told Horn's sub-committee.\n",
      "Although weapons systems are not set to launch automatically by computers, problems could crop up when the weapons interact with command and control systems that are operated by computers, congressional staffers explained.\n",
      "During the Gulf War, a command and control system that was scheduled to run for 12 hours began shutting down weapon systems it was in contact with after running a few hours past its deadline.\n",
      "\"That would obviously be a disaster, but they're working on it,\" said one staffer.\n",
      "Social security is also a primary focus of concern, but for more political reasons. Millions of voters depend on their social security cheques for meeting basic living expenses. If the cheques were delayed or cancelled, Congress would probably be inundated with thousands of complaints.\n",
      "\"They started the earliest but they have a lot to do and still aren't finished,\" a staffer said. \"My sense is that they will be fine.\"\n",
      "CONCERN OVER AVIATION\n",
      "One agency of concern, according to congressional staffers, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the country's air traffic control system and inspects commercial airplanes.\n",
      "\"The Department of Transportation is very worrisome,\" one staffer said. \"The FAA is still in the assessment phase. That's the one that's a real concern.\"\n",
      "The agency cannot give an estimate of how many lines of code it has that must be changed, or how much that might cost, until it completes an assessment expected by the end of May, according to Mary Powers-King, who heads the FAA's information technology effort.\n",
      "\"It's somewhat painful because no new funding has been appropriated and we're having to reprogramme to absorb the activity,\" Powers-King said. \"That is a big part of the reason why we started late. We've got that figured out now and we've got to just bite the bullet.\"\n",
      "Overall, recent estimates indicate the federal government will need to spend $2.4 to $2.5 billion to identify and correct year 2000 computer problems, Katzen said. The estimate has risen slightly from about $2.3 billion a few months ago.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised to see them come another ($100 to $300 million) as we continue through the process of assessment,\" Katzen said. \"But I think that we've got it in just about the right ballpark.\"\n",
      "In a February 7, 1997 report to Congress, the budget office projected that the military needed the largest portion of the money for updates. The Air Force would require $371 million, the Army $218 million, the Navy $90 million and other defence-related areas $291 million.\n",
      "Other big spenders in the report were the Treasury Department, needing $319 million, and the Veterans Administration, needing $144 million.\n",

      "The chairman of an influential National Research Council report on computer encoding technology said Thursday the report's year-old findings are still valid.\n",
      "Kenneth Dam, a law professor at the University of Chicago, told Reuters that an approach favored by the Clinton administration to allow government access to coded information is still not ready for widespread use despite advances in computer encryption.  \n",
      "Encryption, increasingly important for online commerce and global communications on the Internet, scrambles information and renders it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "The Clinton administration bars the export of strong encryption unless the products incorporate a feature known as key recovery which allows the government to decode messages by gaining access to the software keys.\n",
      "Such access is needed to catch criminals or terrorists who might be using encrypted communications, the administration argues.  \n",
      "But poorly designed key recovery systems might create new vulnerabilities by letting hackers get access to the keys as well, critics contend.\n",
      "Echoing the findings of last May's NRC report, Dam said key recovery is not sufficiently reliable yet.\n",
      "\"It may be that one would have more confidence today than we did a year ago and still more next year,\" Dam told Reuters after speaking to a conference here sponsored by the Brookings and Cato Institutes. \"It's not yet quite ready.\"  \n",
      "\"The idea, which I stand by, is that one shouldn't require the implementation of key escrow even as part of some general infrastructure project until we're absolutely certain that we have not created a monster problem for ourselves,\" he said.\n",
      "The report also recommended that strict export controls on encryption, opposed by U.S. software makers, be progressively relaxed.\n",
      "Under a Clinton plan that took effect at the beginning of the year, companies may now export strong encryption products but only if they include key recovery. Companies promising to include key recovery within two years may export medium strength encryption.\n",
      "That continues to draw the ire of software makers and privacy advocates opposed to government snooping.\n",
      "Properly balancing the conflicting interests in the encryption debate is a difficult task, Dam conceded.\n",
      "\"Law enforcement and national security concerns do conflict with individual privacy and the legitimate needs of business and with the international future of our software industry,\" he said in a speech to the conference.\n",

      "Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged lawmakers on Thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers.\n",
      "Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms.\n",
      "\"Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organisations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets,\" Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses.\n",
      "But Rubin sidestepped the controversial question of whether banks should be allowed to merge with commercial companies, instead offering Congress two proposals -- one that would allow such combinations, and another that would not.\n",
      "Greenspan acknowledged that the barriers separating banks and commercial companies will eventually crumble with the continued advance of technology.\n",
      "But he urged caution in knocking them down now, in part because of uncertainties over how that would affect the U.S. financial system.\n",
      "\"Any wider authorisation of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernisation,\" Greenspan said.\n",
      "The administration plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, according to Rubin.\n",
      "The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, took its place with several bills already introduced in Congress to overhaul the Glass Steagall Act of 1933. \"We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "Congress and the banking industry have been working to reform the law for more than a decade without success. But this year, previous opponents of reform have come to the table as regulators and courts have chipped away at the law and granted banks some new powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy advocates warned Wednesday that the Clinton administration's latest proposal to modify controversial computer encryption export restrictions would trample on citizens' rights in cyberspace.\n",
      "Encryption products scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "Under a Clinton executive order that took effect Jan. 1, U.S. companies can export stronger encryption than previously allowed, but only if they promise to incorporate within two years features allowing the government to decode any message.\n",
      "The strongest encryption, an increasingly important component of online commerce and global communications, cannot be exported unless it already includes a feature known as \"key recovery\" that allows the government to crack the code by gaining access to the software keys.\n",
      "The administration's latest proposal, being circulated in the form of draft legislation, is designed to encourage companies to produce software with key recovery features.\n",
      "The proposal also establishes the legal foundation for a key recovery system, criminalizing the improper disclosure of keys, for example.\n",
      "Although domestic use of strong encryption is not restricted and the Clinton proposal affirms that policy, privacy advocates contended the government's \"encouragement\" would quickly devolve into a de facto requirement.\n",
      "\"The proposed bill would destroy any prospect of privacy and security on the Internet by opening a huge window of vulnerability to the private communications of Internet users,\" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit public interest group.\n",
      "Under the proposal, the government would have \"carte blanche\" access to coded messages, Berman added.\n",
      "Commerce Undersecretary William Reinsch, in testimony last week, said the proposal would not compel participation. \"The administration has stated on numerous occassions that we do not support mandatory key escrow and key recovery, \" he said.\n",
      "Opposition to the Clinton approach continued to simmer elsewhere as well this week.\n",
      "In Congress, where several bills have been introduced to gut the export restrictions, Republicans on the House Commerce Committee pressed administration officials for a defence of the current policy.\n",
      "Committee Chairman Tom Bliley of Virginia and Representative Rick White of Washington sent letters asking for more information to the Commerce Department, FBI and National Security Agency, among others.\n",
      "White already has endorsed one of the bills to relax the restrictions. \"It's time to take a close look at the export restrictions that are in place,\" White said. The Internet should not be \"stifled by federal regulations and ill-conceived public policies.\"\n",
      "In the private sector, people in the software industry said they expected a high-profile application to export encryption from Sybase Inc. would be rejected soon. Some companies, including International Business Machines Corp., have received permission to export encryption under the current policy.\n",
      "Commerce Department officials declined to comment on pending applications.\n",
      "The export rules require that key recovery products allow government access to stored data, like a document saved on a computer hard drive, as well as live communications, like a telephone conversation or electronic mail message.\n",
      "Encryption customers only want to buy products with key recovery for stored data, U.S. companies have argued. Allowing key recovery of live communications is a more complicated and expensive proposition, they said.\n",
      "Sybase sells software that allows a computer user on a network to access a database of information located on another computer on the network. The company applied for permission earlier this month to export a product that allows for access to keys used to encrypt the stored information in a database.\n",
      "But to enhance security, the Sybase programme also encrypts the communications over the network between the computer user and the database. The product does not provide access to the keys used to encrypt those communications, according to Tom Parenty, director of data and communication security at the Emeryville, Calif.-based company.\n",
      "\"We're doing nothing for communications because there is absolutely no customer demand or need for any kind of key recovery for communications,\" Parenty said. \"What we are proposing is something that we can sell.\"\n",

      "The heads of 10 leading U.S. high-technology companies descended on Washington Wednesday to lobby for stronger laws protecting their products from piracy.\n",
      "Executives including Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates and Intel Corp Chairman Andrew Grove met with senators in the morning, reporters in the afternoon, and Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley later in the day. They came armed with fresh research indicating that the software industry has been a key factor boosting economic growth.  \n",
      "\"The PC software industry is a very fast growing, very innovative business,\" Gates told reporters. \"Government statisics don't accurately capture all the things going on.\"\n",
      "According to research done for the Business Software Alliance, the industry totaled $102.8 billion in 1996, directly employing 619,000 people and paying wages of $36.4 billion. Another 1.4 million American workers owed their jobs indirectly to the industry.\n",
      "The industry has grown at a rate of 12.5 percent annually since 19890, more than twice as fast as the U.S. economy, the study concluded.\n",
      "To spur further gains, the software executives urged political leaders to strengthen international laws protecting intellectual property,\n",
      "Piracy cost the industry $11.2 billion in 1996, the report noted. Although a considerable proportion of the piracy occurred in China, the software executives said they favored extending most favored nation status to China.\n",
      "Government could also promote software sales by relaxing strict export limits on computer encoding technology, the executives said.\n",
      "Encryption software, which scrambles information and renders it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" was the realm of spies and generals. But the technology has become an increasingly critical security component of electronic commerce and global communications networks.\n",
      "While U.S. companies cannot export powerful encryption products, foreign companies are cleaning up, the executives warned. Last month, for example, Sun Microsystems said it would market an encryption program made in Russia with some of its products to evade the export limits.\n",
      "\"The cat's already out of the bag,\" Novell Inc Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said. U.S. law should be modified to allow export of any encryption product already available abroad, he said.\n",

      "U.S. Senators on Tuesday sharply criticized a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule forcing companies to disclose their use of derivatives.\n",
      "Both the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board have issued proposals to make companies disclose more about derivatives use following some high-profile losses on the complex instruments in 1994.  \n",
      "Derivatives, financial instruments such as options and futures whose value is based on an underlying stock or commodity price, were involved in the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., and losses exceeding $100 million at Procter &amp; Gamble Co.\n",
      "The SEC adopted its rules last month, while the FASB is still working on its proposal.\n",
      "On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, senators took aim at both approaches, charging that the added expenses and complications would discourage companies from properly using derivatives to reduce risk.  \n",
      "\"One of my chief concerns when I came to the Senate in 1993 was whether we had too many unnecessary rules and regulations,\" North Carolina Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth said at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee. \"I am concerned this may be the case with the SEC's new rule.\"\n",
      "\"At this juncture, I don't agree with the direction we're heading in,\" Faircloth added.\n",
      "FASB is a private organization that makes accounting standards, but the SEC must approve its rules to make them binding on public companies.  \n",
      "Senators questioned whether the the recent rule proposals adequately addressed the 1994 problems. While the rules focus on derivatives, the 1994 situations were caused not by the instruments but by the people in charge of those investments, Sen. Christopher Dodd said.\n",
      "\"I think what most of us concluded was the problem there was not the instrument but the human element,\" the Connecticut Democrat said.\n",
      "And neither rule would affect Orange County, a municipal government not bound by most FASB or SEC rules, the legislators observed.  \n",
      "\"Interestingly enough, the regulation, as almost always happens, doesn't even apply to Orange County -- it applies to corporate America,\" said Sen. Phil Gramm, who presided over the hearing.\n",
      "Gramm opened the hearing expressing his doubts about the rules. After hearing from industry representatives and SEC commissioner Steven Wallman, the Texas Republican said he was still worried.\n",
      "\"I'm not converted,\" Gramm said. \"In fact, every concern I had at the beginning, I have even more now.\"  \n",
      "Gramm was a prominent opponent of the accounting board in an earlier dispute over proposed rules on executive stock options.\n",
      "In an unprecedented vote, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution in 1994 urging FASB to abandon the plan that would have required companies to reduce earnings to account for the value of stock options granted to executives. A few months after the vote, the board quashed the proposal.\n",
      "That was the only previous time he took on the FASB, Gramm said after Tuesday's hearing. \"I just never could figure out where they were coming from,\" he said.  \n",
      "The Republican Congress has since passed a law allowing legislators to overturn agency rules directly, Gramm said. \"I think we have the power in Congress to override the regulation if we decided to,\" he said, but added \"I haven't made that decision.\"\n",
      "Commissioner Wallman defended the new rules and said the SEC had made several changes from an earlier proposal to address industry complaints.\n",
      "He denied the rules would discourage companies from properly using derivatives to manage and reduce business risk.\n",
      "\"Quite the opposite, the better investors understand the potential impact of market-sensitive instruments on their investments, the more likely it is that management will be able to engage in appropriate risk management,\" Wallman said.\n",

      "Federal bank regulators have begun prodding U.S. financial institutions to prepare for possible computer problems in the year 2000.\n",
      "Many computers and software programs record only the last two digits of a year and could mistakenly treat the year 2000 as the year 1900. For banks, confused computers could erroneously trigger a wave of bounced checks, missed loan payments and miscalculated interest rates.\n",
      "In letters to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, regulators said they were aware of the dangers.  \n",
      "The various agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said they had formed an interagency working group to address the issue, often referred to as the \"Millennium Bug.\"\n",
      "\"The costs of making systems year 2000 compliant will be substantial and may affect some banks' earnings,\" Comptroller Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 national banks, wrote in a letter dated March 21. \"Most experts believe that even the most prepared organizations will encounter some problems.\"  \n",
      "\"The year 2000 rollover could pose substantial risks to the financial services industry,\" Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, warned.\n",
      "Analysts have said corporations and governments might have to spend $300 to $600 billion worldwide to correct the problem by rewriting software and reprogramming hardware.\n",
      "Even if banks correct all of their own computers, they could be brought down by computer errors from their major customers or third-party vendors, the regulators added.  \n",
      "Bank examiners will question banks about year 2000 preparations this year, hopefully alerting them in time for solutions to be implemented and tested well before the end of 1999.\n",
      "Some programs may fail much sooner as they try to process current transactions such as mortgage loans that extend beyond the year 2000.\n",
      "\"This is not a project that can be delayed or the deadline extended,\" Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Director Nicholas Ketcha wrote in a recent memo to the agency's regional directors. \"Because of the nature of some date related calculations, many software programs currently running which are not year 2000 compliant may fail at some point prior to December 31, 1999.\"\n",

      "The merger of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Alex. Brown Inc. sends a clear signal to Congress that the nation's banking laws enacted during the Depression have fallen hopelessly behind market trends.\n",
      "\"It's another example of the kind of progress that is being made in the market,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, president of the consulting firm ISD/Shaw. \"The industry is modernizing even if Congress is lagging on modernization legislation.\"\n",
      "Legislators have argued for more than a decade about repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 -- enacted in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 -- which prohibits banks from offering other financial services like securities or insurance.\n",
      "The debate is still raging in Congress, but this time around the market may exert more influence. In the last year, federal courts and bank regulators have substantially diminished Glass-Steagall's reach.\n",
      "\"This is the most profound example that Glass-Steagall is no longer on life-support systems; it's dead,\" said Larry LaRocco, a bank industry lobbyist and former congressman. \"Now we need to move on and deal with the other issues.\"\n",
      "In Congress, lawmakers involved in drafting bank reform legislation said they had received the market's message.\n",
      "\"This proposed merger simply underscores the need for timely Congressional action,\" House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R.-Iowa, said.\n",
      "The ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, Texas Rep. Henry Gonzalez, said the safety and soundness of the banking system could be jeopardized by ad hoc mergers.\n",
      "\"As it is today, it is only a matter of luck that restructuring deals like this will truly serve the best interests of the market and the people who depend on it,\" Gonzalez said. \"Congress can't afford to do nothing and hope that everything will be all right.\"\n",
      "One of the biggest controversies to be addressed is whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial commercial firms, said LaRocco, who is managing director at the American Bankers Association's Securities Association.\n",
      "Bankers Trust said Sunday it would acquire Baltimore-based Alex. Brown in a stock deal valued at $1.7 billion.\n",
      "In acquiring Alex. Brown, Bankers Trust was taking advantage of a move by the Federal Reserve last December to more than double the amount of revenue a bank securities subsidiary could earn without running afoul of Glass-Steagall Act.\n",
      "Bankers Trust Chief Executive Officer Frank Newman told reporters Monday that after the acquisition securities activity would constitute about 20 percent of revenues on a pro forma, or estimated, basis. That would have exceeded the previous cap of 10 percent but is permissable under the revised 25 percent cap.\n",
      "Fed officials declined to comment on the merger.\n",
      "The merger also benefited from Fed actions to eliminate previously required barriers, known as firewalls, separating a bank from its securities subsidiary.\n",
      "Removing the firewalls allowed banks to cut costs by eliminating duplication between the two activities while allowing additional benefits from the combination.\n",
      "The relaxation of firewalls has drawn some criticism from Congress, where Sen. Lauch Faircloth, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's Financial Institutions subcommittee, held a hearing questioning the move.\n",
      "But the North Carolina Republican now seems satisfied with most of what the Fed has done or proposed. \"We're going to entrust to the Fed that they'll continue to do the prudent thing,\" Faircloth's legislative director James Hyland said.\n",
      "Faircloth's remaining concerns center on two of the 28 firewall reforms proposed by the Fed in January, allowing a bank to buy investments underwritten by its securities firm for its own trust accounts and lending money to an investor to purchase underwritten securities, Hyland said.\n",

      "With thousands of new users signing on every day, the Internet's data routes are brimming with traffic and some predict the imminent demise of the net due to overcrowding.\n",
      "\"Demand for the Internet is outstripping supply,\" said Mark Luker, programme director of the National Science Foundation's network infrastructure project.\n",

      "MFS Communications Inc, which runs Mae East and its California counterpart Mae West, describes it as \"the busiest public exchange point on the Internet.\" Peak loads run as high as 53 million bytes per second.\n",
      "Until April 1995, the National Science Foundation (NSF) managed and financed the common highway underpinning most of the Internet, called a network backbone.\n",
      "Before the network was phased out in favour of privately managed networks, traffic increased steadily from 1.3 trillion bytes a month in March 1991 to a high of 17.8 trillion bytes in late 1994, the equivalent of transfering the entire contents of the Library of Congress every four months.\n",
      "The private system sends data across a host of different company networks and crowded interchange points. As the load continues to increase, MFS and the Internet providers can add more fibre optic lines and switching equipment, but that is expensive and still may fail to keep up with rising usage.\n",
      "Some providers are setting up smaller, one-to-one interchanges to relieve the burden on Mae East. MCI Communications, which has seen a 5,000 percent increase in Internet traffic since the beginning of 1995, set up 22 circuits for one-to-one exchanges.\n",
      "For now, the best solution is to keep adding hardware, said Luker. \"But in the long run, you can solve problems by adding knowledge to the system instead of brute force,\" he said.\n",

      "If an Internet user in Japan tries to download a web page in New York, the data must travel all the way around the world, even if another user in Japan has just downloaded the same page. With a cache, the second user could grab the page from a closer computer that the data had already gone through.\n",
      "\"A cache automatically duplicates the pages that are used most often,\" Luker explained. The NSF had sponsored a study at the National Laboratory for Advanced Networking Research of a cache that \"is showing great improvements in traffic.\"\n",
      "A procedure called multicasting could also reduce repetitive data transfers, said Robert Hagens, MCI's director of Internet engineering. Multicasting sends a stream of data such as sound or video across the net that can be accessed by many users.\n",
      "\"If you look at the radio stations beginning to appear on the Internet, they commonly require each listener to open a connection to the station so you've got a lot of duplication,\" Hagens said. \"With multicast, you put that data into a stream of packets that only get duplicated when they have to.\"\n",
      "New ways of charging for Internet usage may alter the traffic patterns, as well. At the moment, most users pay a flat rate for Internet service regardless of how much capacity they use. Sending e-mail is considerably less taxing than sending live videos, but users pay the same for both.\n",
      "\"The Internet is a mature technology but an immature economy,\" said Hal Varian, dean of the University of California's School of Information Management and Systems. The current pricing model does not provide incentives to Internet providers to offer high quality service, he said.\n",
      "People who need high priority channels for sending live video might have to pay more, Varian said, but basic tasks like sending e-mail will remain essentially free.\n",
      "Varian also predicted Internet service providers will begin paying each other based on the amount of traffic they exchange, much as phone carriers make settlement payments to foreign telecommunications companies for completing international calls.\n",
      "Much of the slowdown experienced by individuals trying to surf the World Wide Web is caused by limits at each end of a connection rather than by delays moving across the network.\n",
      "Web pages reside on computer servers that can be overwhelmed when too many requests arrive at the same time. And many individuals access the Internet through relatively slow modem links.\n",
      "Such delays could be eased by a proposal from Sun Microsystems to create a new Internet standard for the way computers access each others' files.\n",
      "Called Web Network File System, the protocol reduces the burden on the computer holding the web pages, speeding the transfer of files and allowing three times as many Internet surfers to gain access at one time, according to Sanjay Sinha, head of Sun's Solaris Server project.\n",
      "\"In real life, most web servers are heavily loaded,\" Sinha said. Sun's web file system \"doesn't require that load.\"\n",
      "User delays are real, but by some measures the Internet's performance has actually improved over the last few years.\n",
      "Matrix Information and Directory Services of Austin, Texas, compiles a weather report which it publishes on the Internet.\n",
      "The report, updated every four hours, shows how long it takes a small message to travel from Matrix's headquarters to 4,500 major computers around the world and back.\n",
      "Traffic clogging the Internet slows the round trips. The reports show huge fluctuations in Internet traffic, with \"rush hour\" occuring weekdays as business users log on.\n",
      "But the average delay declined by 30 percent between January 1994 and January 1996, according a report by Matrix.\n",

      "Sun Microsystem Inc's decision to use powerful computer encoding software made in Russia put added pressure on the Clinton administration on Monday to relax strict U.S. export controls on similiar products made by American companies.\n",
      "Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" have become a critical component of global communications and online commerce over the Internet.  \n",
      "But encryption's power to prevent hackers from snooping on telephone calls and credit card numbers sent over the Internet can also be employed by drug cartels or terrorists to thwart law enforcement survellience.\n",
      "Clinton administration officials oppose allowing exports of powerful U.S. encryption programs unless the software is designed to allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.\n",
      "Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and others have said repeatedly that the encryption \"genie\" is not yet \"out of the bottle.\"  \n",
      "\"It's an arguably legal way around what is clearly a ludicrous export control policy of the administration that is creating jobs in Russia,\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, introduced one of several measures being considered by Congress to relax the export controls. The bill was passed by the House Judiciary Committee last week and is awaiting action by the International Relations Committee.\n",
      "If U.S. export restrictions stay in place, industry officials warned, other companies will go the same route.\n",
      "\"A lot of U.S. companies have been contemplating this,\" said Jon Englund, vice president at the Information Technology Association of America. \"Sun's move is the first example of a trend that will continue. We'll see more and more of that.\"\n",

      "Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.\n",
      "Once the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.\n",
      "This year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, which are programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "The new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed. But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.\n",
      "The government says it needs the ability to crack strong encryption to catch criminals and terrorists.\n",
      "While a few companies, most notably International Business Machines, have obtained export licenses under the new policy, most high-tech companies remain frustrated.\n",
      "They want to be able to export very strong encryption without including the government access features.\n",
      "Privacy advocates also oppose the current Clinton policy, which they say puts too much power in the hands of government.\n",
      "Since the government does not require guaranteed access to the keys to one's home, it should not be given such access to the keys to one's data, they argue. \"My lock, my key,\" is the slogan on their buttons this week.\n",
      "In congress, the passage of time has crystallised the issue for many members and both sides in the debate have found new allies. Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favour of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.\n",
      "The full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.\n",
      "At the House encryption hearing, Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch, deputy director of the National Security Agency William Crowell and a member of the Department of Justice criminal division, will defend the Clinton policy.\n",
      "The Senate will also hear from FBI director Louis Freeh and special encryption envoy David Aaron.\n",
      "Industry representatives at the hearings will include officials from Netscape Communications Corp., one of the most vocal administration critics, and Microsoft Corp.\n",

      "The number of banks charging non-customers for using their automated teller machines doubled over the past six months, a consumer watchdog group said Tuesday.\n",
      "About 45 percent of ATMs added the controversial surcharge, on top of the fee most consumers already pay their own banks for using another bank's machine, up from 23 percent in October, according to a survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n",
      "The non-profit consumer advocacy group also found that the average fee had risen 20 percent to $1.15 from 96 cents.\n",
      "\"Banks aren't earning money the old-fashioned way. Instead, they're gouging consumers,\" Edmund Mierzwinski, programme director for the group, told a press conference.\n",
      "Two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned the practice of charging non-customers and 12 other states, along with the federal government, are considering similar legislation.\n",
      "Mierzwinski endorsed those efforts and said consumers should avoid using machines that impose a surcharge.\n",
      "The rise in fees followed a decision one year ago by the two largest ATM networks, Visa's Plus and Mastercard's Cirrus, to lift a prohibition on surcharges.\n",
      "Banks defended the practice and said the additional fees helped pay for ATMs in new locations.\n",
      "\"The marketplace should decide the prices for ATMs, not the government,\" the American Bankers Association said in a statement. \"Price controls will only inhibit innovation and put a halt to future ATM growth.\"\n",
      "Banks added almost 17,000 new ATMs last year, a 13 percent increase, according to a survey by the publication Bank Network News. With surcharges now permitted, \"ATM growth is accelerating,\" editor Don Davis said. \"It's a better business to be in, so more people are getting in.\"\n",
      "Big banks were more likely than smaller ones to impose a surcharge, according to the survey. Among the 300 largest banks, 53 percent of ATMs had a fee while only 40 percent of smaller bank ATMs and 6 percent of credit union ATMs charged a fee.\n",
      "That could raise antitrust law implications if large banks banded together to impose fees and drive smaller competitors out of business, Mierzwinski charged. \"Not only are big banks using their monopoly muscle to punish consumers with higer fees, but their strategy is to use the surcharge to hurt small banks and credit unions as well,\" he said.\n",
      "Customers of small banks, which have fewer of their own ATMs, would likely have to pay a surcharge more often.\n",
      "Banks say free-market competition is functioning properly. \"Competitions is already keeping ATM pricing in check,\" the ABA said.\n",
      "The consumer group said it surveyed 860 ATMs chosen at random in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The highest rates of surcharging were in the South, with 93 percent of Texas ATMs imposing a surcharge, 95 percent in Georgia, and 88 percent in Viginia and North Carolina, the group said.\n",

      "Two members of Congress criticised the Federal Reserve Thursday for what they called its \"woefully inadequate\" record of hiring and promoting women and minorities.\n",
      "Representative Henry Gonzalez and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., in a letter to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, said several discrimination lawsuits against the bank \"show a clear need for reform.\"\n",
      "The letter paired persistent Fed critic Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas serving his 19th term in Congress, with second-term Illinois Democrat Jackson, son of the well-known civil rights leader.\n",
      "A Fed spokesman declined comment.\n",
      "One of the lawsuits, filed against the central bank in January by four black secretaries, may be expanded as 15 other current and former employees have asked to join the litigation, the two Democratic lawmakers said.\n",
      "\"As one of the nation's primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve should serve as a model for the banking system it regulates,\" the two wrote to Greenspan.\n",
      "\"Despite being at the forefront in carrying out the nation's laws, we are concerned that the Federal Reserve's record of diversity in hiring and promotion is woefully inadequate.\"\n",
      "The four black secretaries filed suit Jan. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of themselves and \"all others similarly situated.\"\n",
      "A black Fed researcher won a similiar suit against the bank in 1994, the Congressmen noted.\n",
      "Gonzalez and Jackson asked Greenspan to assess the validity of the complaints and report if any action has been taken to address the alleged problems.\n",
      "They did commend the central bank for increasing the number of women and minorities among the most highly paid Fed employees over the past three years.\n",
      "In 1993, only one woman and one non-white were among the 35 top paid staff earning more than $125,000. Now, with 72 people making that much, 11 are women and five are minorities.\n",
      "The hiring of additional women \"is an important step in ending what appeared to be gender bias in the selection of top staff, but it is still below comparable government standards which are also too low,\" Gonzalez and Jackson said. Minority representation \"remains poor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A bill to dramatically relax U.S. export controls on computer encoding technology will be considered by a House Judiciary subcommittee on Wednesday, congressional staff members said Monday.\n",
      "Heading for a vote, the bill garnered an endorsement from a politically diverse coalition of Internet privacy advocates.\n",
      "In a related development Netscape Communications Corp. said the Commerce Department gave the Internet software company permission to export some products containing stronger encoding, or encryption, features.\n",
      "Current U.S. laws strictly limit export of products with encryption, software that scrambles information and renders it unreadable unless one has a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "Netscape, which had been allowed to export encryption software with keys 40 bits long, said it will now be able to sell abroad products with 56-bit keys. The longer the key, the harder it is to crack an encoded message, and the 56-bit key makes it 65,000 times tougher to decode.\n",
      "The Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, sponsored by Virginia Republican Representative Robert Goodlatte, would allow U.S. companies to export strong encryption programmes if such products were being offered by foreign competitors.\n",
      "The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, which it argues would allow international criminals and terrorists to get easy access to encryption that could thwart law enforcement agencies' efforts.\n",
      "Under the adminstration's current policy, strong encryption can be exported only if it allows the government to crack the codes by recovering the software keys.\n",
      "Netscape has promised to abide by that policy, said its chief scientist, Taher Elgamal. Within two years, its products will allow the government to decode encrypted data by gaining access to the keys.\n",
      "If the bill is approved by the Courts and Intellectual Property subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee will consider it, said David Lehman, legislative counsel for Goodlatte.\n",
      "The legislation will sail through the subcommittee and be voted on by the full committee in a few weeks, according to Shabbir Safdar, executive director of the Voters Telecommunications Watch, one of the groups endorsing the measure Monday.\n",
      "\"It looks very promising with 78 co-sponsors,\" Safdar said. \"This is the best hope in the House for real encryption reform this decade.\"\n",
      "Others who endorsed the bill included the Centre for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Americans for Tax Reform.\n",
      "A similiar bill is pending in the Senate, where the Commerce Committee is expected to vote on its version in the next few weeks.\n",
      "Not all civil libertarians favour the legislation as currently drafted. Another group, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote Goodlatte this week asking him to delete a provision of the bill that would create new criminal penalties for using computer encryption \"in the furtherance of the commission of a criminal offence.\"\n",
      "The group generally backed Goodlatte's efforts but said in its letter the new criminal penalties \"could have a series of unintended consequences that would easily undermine the other desirable features of the bill.\"\n",
      "From the Internet community, signers included the Internet Society and two private companies, Cybercash Inc. and Digex Inc.\n",
      "Instead of criminalizing use of encryption, the group said prosecutors should rely on existing federal and state laws prohibiting obstruction of justice and concealment of evidence.\n",

      "Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, outlining a plan to overhaul Depression-era laws governing the U.S. financial sector, said Wednesday the Clinton administration favoured allowing banks to enter the securities and insurance fields.\n",
      "\"The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,\" Rubin said in a speech here.\n",
      "The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. \"We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "Increased competition in financial services should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said.\n",
      "The new proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.\n",
      "\"Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.\n",
      "Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.\n",
      "Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms.\n",
      "If banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.\n",

      "But the committee is not intended as a forum to debate the merits of the current export policy, Eckert told Reuters.\n",
      "\"This is not a debating forum towards policy in general,\" Eckert said in a telephone interview. \"It is the advisory group to provide input to implementation of our policy.\"\n",
      "Current law restricts the export of encryption technology, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"  \n",
      "But many software companies, including Microsoft Corp and Netscape Communications Corp, oppose the export rules, which they say hamper sales abroad. And civil libertarians contend the export rules permit excessive governmental intrusions even within the United States.\n",
      "Under the current policy, in effect since the beginning of 1997, the Clinton administration permits companies to export powerful encryption programs but only if the products allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.  \n",
      "Companies can export medium-strength encryption if they promise to incorporate so-called key recovery features within two years.\n",
      "The committee is \"to advise on the range of issues of implementation of key recovery...not just the technical issues, but also law enforcement and access,\" Eckert said.\n",
      "The administration was criticized by privacy advocates last month for drafting legislation that might allow easy government access to software keys without a court order.  \n",
      "While emphasizing that the committee was intended for law enforcement and corporate officials, Eckert said no groups would be excluded.\n",
      "\"We haven't excluded anybody,\" she said. \"That's why we published a notice in the Federal Register and advised everyone and anyone who's interested to submit their comments and suggestions.\"  \n",

      "Currently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen.\n",
      "But Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net.\n",
      "\"This plan risks the stability of the Internet,\" he said.\n",
      "The current system functions \"pretty well\" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times.\n",
      "Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions will come out with its own plan soon for reforming the domain name registration system, Telage added.\n",
      "While Network Solutions charges $100 for a two-year registration, the new firms will be free to compete on price. All names will be maintained in a central, shared database.\n",

      "\"Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin,\" one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. \"But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.\"\n",
      "While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.\n",
      "The administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.\n",
      "But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labor and consumer groups.\n",
      "And during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.\n",
      "Bowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favor allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a \"basket\" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.\n",
      "But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.\n",
      "Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.\n",
      "Almost everyone favors \"functional regulation,\" meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.\n",
      "But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.\n",

      "Goodlatte's bill would also write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.\n",
      "The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony. That provision came on an amendment from Massachusetts Democrat Representative William Delahunt which replaced a broader criminalization provision included in the original bill.\n",

      "The rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards could be hurt by premature government regulation, one of the top U.S. bank regulators said in a report issued Wednesday.\n",
      "An array of companies, including banks, credit card networks and others, are trying to popularize stored value or \"smart\" cards that carry electronic currency. But the cards have yet to catch on with consumers.\n",
      "Federal Reserve Board, which regulates banks and runs the payment system used to tranfer hundreds of billions of dollars a day among financial institutions, evaluated possible regulation of smart cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.\n",
      "\"Early regulation of electronic stored-value products could cause higher regulatory costs than later regulation,\" the Fed said in its report. Regulations could be costly for smart card providers and might arbitrarily favor one type of product over another, the Fed said.\n",
      "\"Given the limited experience with stored value products to date, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the benefits to consumers from any particular Regulation E provision would outweigh the corresponding costs of compliance,\" the report noted.\n",
      "Regulation E sets out the Fed's rules for electronic funds transfers, including protecting consumers against fraudulent or mistaken transfers.\n",
      "Sen Bob Bennett, chairman of the Senate banking Committee's subcommittee on financial services and technology who criticized an initial Fed plan to regulate smart cards, welcomed the report.\n",
      "\"For the first time, the Federal Reserve has carefully considered the cost of action as well as the potential cost of inaction with regard to the implementation of new regulations on the fledgling stored-value card industry,\" the Utah Republican said.\n",
      "Last April, the Fed had proposed applying some parts of the funds transfer act to smart cards. But Bennett and others in Congress opposed that move and passed legislation requiring a report before any action was taken.\n",
      "Early regulation could have some benefits, however, the Fed said. Government rules have \"the potential to speed up development by promoting standardization and by removing uncertainty.\"\n",
      "In any event, the market will probably grow slowly, the Fed predicted. \"Widespread public acceptance of stored-value products, if it occurs at all, will likely develop slowly over many years,\" the report said. \"Their introduction seems unlikely to change the fundamental nature of our current payment system in the near future.\"\n",
      "David Jung, senior analyst at the market research firm Killen &amp; Associates, agreed. \"We expect solid growth of about 25 percent a year but we don't see any break-out yet,\" Jung said.\n",
      "Volume of smart card transaction is expected to grow from under one billion transactions this year to about 10 billion worldwide in 2001, Jung said.\n",

      "But in the rarefied air of Congress, where legislation often moves at a glacial pace, few would equate \"Washington time\" with the speed of cyberspace. That may be changing, however, as Congress struggles to come to grips with the Net as a phenomenon with great potential for reaching voters.\n",
      "In the 1996 election, exit polls showed more than one-fourth of voters were \"wired\" and about 10 percent primarily used online sources of information in deciding how to vote. Responding to the surge in Net use by voters, congressional Internet use also has skyrocketed by some measures.\n",

Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district encompasses Silicon Valley, created a special area on her Web site to give constituents individualized information (http://www-eshoo.house.gov). A constituent sends Eshoo a query and receives a personal answer posted on a private part of the site accessible only to that individual with a password.\n",

      "Much more remains to be done to educate users and legislators. While the text of bills is available online, some advocates want Congress to make more information available.\n",

      "A bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representative Wednesday.\n",
      "By a vote of 421 to seven, the House adopted the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity.\n",
      "\"The truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need,\" Representative Henry Gonzalez said during the debate on the bill. The Texas Democrat urged the Senate to quickly pass the measure.\n",
      "Consumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year.\n",
      "\"I think it would be hard for the Senate to resist moving forward,\" Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union, said. The House vote \"brings us really close to getting a final measure.\"\n",
      "But the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments.\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry,\" said Suzanne Hutchinson of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.\n",
      "Currently, mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment, such as 5 percent of the purchase price of a home.\n",
      "Borrowers putting down 20 percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance, which can cost $300 to $900 a year.\n",
      "The bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up 25 percent equity of the original house value.\n",

      "The Federal Reserve may not be taking adequate precautions to ensure that its technological systems and those of the banks it regulates will function properly in the year 2000, Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato warned Monday.\n",
      "After querying U.S. bank regulators on the year 2000 computer issue in February, New York Republican D'Amato said he was troubled by the answers he received from the Fed and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\n",
      "Problems are expected to crop up in computers and software that only record the last two digits of the year. Such a programme might treat the year 2000 as the year 1900, leading to serious miscalculations or even a system crash.\n",
      "D'Amato also queried in February the Office of the Comptroller, which oversees national banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Both entities told D'Amato they had detailed plans to cope with the so-called millennium bug.\n",
      "But D'Amato singled out responses of the Fed and the NCUA as raising concerns over whether they are \"devoting enough attention and resources to solving the year 2000 crisis,\" D'Amato's office said in a release. D'Amato sent both agencies letters Monday asking for additional information.\n",
      "\"Congress expects detailed plans and concrete actions to prevent possible future catastrophes which could endanger the financial well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans,\" D'Amato said. \"We can't wait around, timing is critical.\"\n",
      "Estimates for fixing year 2000 problems in government and the private sector worldwide have ranged as high as $300 billion to $600 billion. Chase Manhattan Bank recently said in a routine filing it planned to spend $250 million on the problem over the next three years.\n",
      "\"We have no comment,\" Fed spokesman Joe Coyne said Monday. \"We will, of course, answer the letter.\"\n",
      "D'Amato said the Fed and the NCUA appeared to lack an aggressive plan of action for coping with the problem, failed to give an assessment about the scope of the problem in institutions they oversee, and did not explain how they would assist regulated institutions that might have a problem.\n",

      "About a dozen companies have already gotten permission this year to export products with encryption, data scrambling technology that renders information unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "But Sybase's products appeared to skirt strict U.S. export rules in effect since the beginning of the year.  \n",
      "\"I was sufficiently surprised when I got word over the phone that we had been approved that I wrote a letter spelling out what I saw as the differences of our approach versus (the regulations),\" said Tom Parenty, Sybase's director of data and communication security. Shortly thereafter, Parenty said, he received written confirmation.\n",
      "To export powerful encryption under the current rules, a company must include features allowing the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys. Companies may export medium-strength encryption by promising to include so-called key recovery features within two years.  \n",
      "The rules indicate that a product must allow key recovery both for encrypted stored data, like a file on a hard drive, as well as for live communications that are encoded.\n",
      "But Sybase's products, Internet transaction software and client-server database programs, will allow for key recovery within two years only of stored data. Encrypted communications between a customer and a web site using the Sybase transaction software, for example, would not allow for government decoding, Parenty said.\n",
      "The key recovery feature was designed to meet the needs of customers, he said.  \n",

      "The plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.\n",
      "Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address \"candyland.com,\" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name.\n",

      "The group said that in the fourth quarter of 1996 late payments jumped to 3.72 percent of credit card accounts, the highest rate since it began tracking delinquencies in 1980 and up from 3.34 percent a year earlier.\n",

      "\"It is worrisome to consider that there was a 44 percent growth in credit card losses and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquencies during the past year,\" Ludwig said.\n",
      "Ludwig also noted that bank chargeoffs on credit cards \"increased significantly\" in January to 6.5 percent of the $220 billion of loans outstanding from 4.7 percent a year earlier.\n",
      "\"These statistics are particularly troubling given the current health of the economy,\" he said.\n",
      "As a result, the Comptroller's office issued an advisory to banks on credit underwriting standards and portfolio credit risk management, Ludwig said.\n",
      "\"The role of the regulator is to take action before potential problems become real problems,\" Ludwig said. \"Our goal is to remind national banks how changes in underwriting standards affect overall portfolio credit risk and to highlight the key component of an effective portfolio credit risk management process.\"\n",
      "Tighter loan standards should prevent the problem from getting out of hand, but losses may grow further before the new standards have an impact, Ludwig said.\n",
      "\"Current losses likely represent weaker credits making their way through the pipeline,\" he said. \"We can expect some continued losses, but hopefully we'll begin to see positive effects of those cautious underwriting decisions.\"\n",
      "Bankers had expected that tighter credit standards put into place in recent years would already have started reducing losses.\n",
      "\"We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,\" American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen said. \"We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now.\"\n",

      "For example, a 25 percent limit on non-financial activity based on total asset size would allow a large bank like Chase Manhattan to acquire all but six of the largest companies in the entire country. If Chase merged with a large securities firm like Salomon Brothers, the Fed data indicated it could acquire even Exxon Corp, fourth largest company in the country based on market value.  \n",
      "A 10 percent limit would leave 18 companies out of Chase's sights or eight from a merged Chase-Salomon.\n",

      "\"ATM's were supposed to reduce costs, and the savings could be passed on to consumers,\" the New York Republican said. \"Now, banks are suddenly claiming that ATM's are no longer cost-effective.\"\n",
      "\"They have decided to soak consumers with multiple fees every time they need to take money out of their accounts,\" D'Amato said.\n",

      "\"The marketplace is at work,\" said Ed Yingling, executive director of the American Bankers Association. \"Consumers, not the government, should decide if they are willing to pay for the convenience of using ATMs at thousands of new locations.\"\n",
      "If surcharges are banned, many newly installed machines would be shuttered, Yingling said.\n",
      "Until last year, the two largest ATM network operators, Mastercard International's Cirrus and Visa USA's Plus, generally prohibited banks from levying surcharges on non-customers. Banks received a portion of the fee on such transactions charged by the customer's own bank.\n",
      "Last April, Cirrus and Plus began allowing ATM surcharges, and the fees have rapidly proliferated. Fifteen states, including Texas, had previously allowed surcharges. More recently, Connecticut and Iowa have passed legislation banning surcharges.\n",
      "The GAO found that about one-third of banks impose surcharges, covering 54 percent of all teller machines in the country. From the end of 1995 to February 1997, the number of ATMs rose 34 percent, while the number imposing a surcharge rose 320 percent, the GAO said.\n",

      "Most derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on or \"derived from\" the value of something else, are linked to interest rates or currencies. Credit derivatives are based on the value of loans, bonds or other lending vehicles.  \n",
      "\"I think, inevitably, the regulators, the lawyers and the accountants tend to be reacting to market developments and, to an extent, trying to keep up,\" William Kroener, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said Friday at a symposium sponsored by the agency.\n",
      "Last August, bank regulators issued preliminary guidance to bank examiners concerning credit derivatives. The guidance emphasized that banks should have policies in place describing how they intend to manage the risks incurred from credit derivatives.  \n",
      "Regulators also asked banks to clearly list credit derivative activity in their call reports instead of lumping the deals into bigger derivative categories such as interest rate swaps.\n",
      "But regulators are likely to revise the guidance and are still considering perhaps the most critical issue, the amount of capital a bank must set aside against its credit derivative portfolio.\n",
      "\"The real issue is whether a credit derivative is different than other loans,\" FDIC chairman Ricki Helfer said at the symposium.  \n",
      "\"Our challenge is to identify the risks embedded in credit derivatives and establish appropriate standards for those risks -- including appropriate capital requirements under the Basle risk-based capital accord,\" Helfer said.\n",
      "Like other derivatives, credit products can be used to limit or reduce risks taken by banks, regulators said.\n",
      "\"They have great potential to enhance the management of credit risk,\" Christine Cumming, senior vice president in the bank supervison group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at the symposium. \"And the better you can manage credit risk the better you can manage all of a bank's risks.\"  \n",
      "So far, regulators see credit derivatives as analagous to letters of credit, Cumming said. When a bank issues a letter of credit, it promises to make good on a loan or bond if the original borrower defaults.\n",
      "\"The capital issue of course is the most important in the sense that it has a dollars and cents implication for banking institutions involved in this market,\" Cumming said.\n",
      "Market innovations could make easier the task of tracking credit risk and assessing capital standards, industry participants said.  \n",
      "J.P. Morgan &amp; Co unveiled a product on Thursday called \"Creditmetrics,\" which is designed to help banks and others better measure and manage credit risk both on derivatives and on ordinary bonds and loans.\n",
      "\"It is only if we can promote better understanding of credit risks in a portfolio framework that we will be able to generate greater transparency of credit risk, and ultimately, greater liquidity in the credit markets,\" Blythe Masters, head of global credit derivatives at the bank, said.\n",
      "CreditMetrics is also meant to \"kick-start or set forward the dialogue we have with bank regulators,\" Masters said. \"One of the perhaps most obvious applications of the CreditMetrics framework is a move towards a more risk-driven allocation of economic and potentially regulatory capital for credit risky instruments, including potentially credit derivatives.\"\n",

      "Scientists working on the next generation of the Internet are finding their first challenge is to convince a sceptical U.S. Congress to fund the project.\n",
      "Rather than stumbling over new hardware or software, the next generation network has quickly run into several road blocks on Capitol Hill.\n",
      "On Tuesday, scientists involved with the project, including President Bill Clinton's top science adviser John Gibbons, will try to soothe concerns at a Senate hearing.\n",
      "Some lawmakers are worried that the project lacks focus and is not sufficiently different from a related university project known as Internet2.\n",
      "The next generation Internet project, announced with great fanfare by Clinton during last year's presidential campaign, aims to send data at 1,000 times the speed of today's net. Higher speed and improved reliability could spur a host of new uses for the network, some with sound and video.\n",
      "Clinton pledged the government would spend $100 million annually for five years to build the super high-speed network and promote its use.\n",
      "The money was to come from reallocating existing research funds, but that plan is already in trouble. In April, the House of Representatives passed a budget for the National Science Foundation that specifically barred any spending on the next generation Internet.\n",
      "The bill is awaiting action by the Senate and could be modified before going to the president's desk.\n",
      "In May, 28 senators sent a letter to science adviser Gibbons complaining about the composition of the next generation Internet's advisory board. The senators, from both political parties but all from rural states, noted that the board's 20 members came from only eight states.\n",
      "\"Instead of a potentially major positive development, therefore, 'Next Generation Internet' and Internet2 becomes a significant source of concern for us,\" the senators wrote in the letter obtained by Reuters.\n",
      "National Science Foundation officials are confident that the programme will go forward. \"Next Generation Internet is a presidential initiative that will have a lot of congressional involvement,\" NSF spokeswoman Elizabeth Gaston said.\n",
      "Congressional staffers said for the time being they remained confused about the administration's priorities. \"Everyone I speak with tells me different things about what these programmes are supposed to do, and which agencies get which portions of the budget,\" one staffer said.\n",
      "To some degree, the confusion reflects the changing fortunes of the Internet. While the original Internet, including connections to universities, was largely funded by government, this time around higher education and industry are more likely to foot some of the bill.\n",
      "More than 100 schools have pledged to spend $50 million a year on Internet2, mainly for higher speed connections and switches. The schools are also seeking corporate sponsorship.\n",
      "Less government involvement for building the plumbing frees up more resources for cutting-edge research, according to George Strawn, director of the NSF's division of networking and communications research.\n",
      "\"The first time around, the NSF sort of had to take the lead to diffuse it to all of higher education because there wasn't an industry yet,\" Strawn said. \"Now that there is, as soon as it becomes cost effective we've got peddlers out there who will find higher education a receptive customer.\"\n",
      "The original Internet began as a Defence Department project called ARPAnet to link far-flung computer centres. Funded mostly by the government until the mid-1980s, the net is now run almost entirely by private companies including MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and BBN Corp.\n",
      "Representatives from those companies gathered with other stars of the Internet community in Virginia two weeks ago for a \"next generation\" planning meeting. Some will return to Washington next week to explain the project to Congress.\n",

      "The number of consumers and businesses filing for U.S. bankruptcy protection continued a dramatic rise, hitting a record 335,073 in the first quarter of 1997, the American Bankruptcy Institute said Tuesday.\n",
      "The first quarter total, the fifth straight quarterly record, was up 26 percent from 266,149 in the first quarter of last year, the non-partisan research group noted.\n",
      "Consumers filed more than 321,000 of the first quarter petitions, about 96 percent of the total and a rise of 27 percent from a year earlier.\n",
      "\"The continued record pace of bankruptcies tracks the sustained growth in consumer spending and debt,\" said the group's executive director, Samuel Gerdano said.\n",
      "After consumer filings surpassed the 1 million mark for the first time last year, the first quarter's pace \"suggests that 1997 will surpass the 1996 record,\" he said.\n",
      "The quarter's bankruptcy surge has already hit some consumer lenders.  Credit card giant Advanta Corp. shocked Wall Street when it reported a loss of 43 cents a share for the first quarter.\n",
      "\"Credit card debt is playing a big role in bankruptcy trends,\" said George Salem, banking industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. in New York. And bankruptcies, in turn, have been depressing credit card company profits, Salem said.\n",
      "\"It's like continuing to be punched and it's going to be a while before it stops,\" Salem said.  Card issuers are cutting back on lending and tightening underwriting standards, but the current problems result from loans made more than a year ago, he said.\n",
      "Looking at the 12 months ended March 31, 1997, Hawaii had the largest increase in bankruptcies, with a 61 percent jump. The northern section of West Virginia followed closely behind with a 60 percent rise.\n",
      "About 70 percent of consumers filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, where unsecured debt is wiped out and the debtor is allowed to keep some property.\n",
      "Some card companies maintain that more consumers should be forced to file for Chapter 13 reorganizations, where debts are not wiped out but must be repaid over several years.\n",
      "Visa USA said this week that its analysis of bankruptcy petitions showed that mounting credit card debt was not responsible for the rise in bankruptcies.\n",
      "\"This analysis refutes the notion that bank credit cards are largely responsible for the increase,\" Visa USA Senior Vice President Kenneth Crone said.\n",
      "Crone said the analysis showed people with an ability to repay some of their debts were filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \"People who can repay a portion of their debts should be required to do so,\" he said. \"Until this changes, lenders and consumers will continue to foot the bill.\"\n",
      "But consumer groups disputed the Visa findings and said excessive credit card debt was directly implicated.\n",
      "\"They are not making the correct comparisons,\" said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. \"The only two figures that really matter are the average income and average credit card debt of bankrupt people.\"\n",
      "Among people who file for Chapter 7, the average income was about $20,000 and the average credit card debt was about $17,000, Brobeck said.\n",

      "The number of banks charging non-customers for using their automated teller machines doubled over the past six months, a consumer watchdog group said Tuesday.\n",
      "About 45 percent of ATMs added the controversial surcharge, on top of the fee most consumers already pay their own banks for using another bank's machine, up from 23 percent in October, according to a survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n",
      "The non-profit consumer advocacy group also found that the average fee had risen 20 percent to $1.15 from 96 cents.\n",
      "\"Banks aren't earning money the old-fashioned way. Instead, they're gouging consumers,\" Edmund Mierzwinski, program director for the group, told a press conference.\n",
      "Two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned the practice of charging non-customers and 12 other states, along with the federal government, are considering similar legislation.\n",
      "Mierzwinski endorsed those efforts and said consumers should avoid using machines that impose a surcharge.\n",
      "The rise in fees followed a decision one year ago by the two largest ATM networks, Visa's Plus and Mastercard's Cirrus, to lift a prohibition on surcharges.\n",
      "Banks defended the practice and said the additional fees helped pay for ATMs in new locations.\n",
      "\"The marketplace should decide the prices for ATMs, not the government,\" the American Bankers Association said in a statement. \"Price controls will only inhibit innovation and put a halt to future ATM growth.\"\n",
      "Banks added almost 17,000 new ATMs last year, a 13 percent increase, according to a survey by the publication Bank Network News. With surcharges now permitted, \"ATM growth is accelerating,\" editor Don Davis said. \"It's a better business to be in, so more people are getting in.\"\n",
      "Big banks were more likely than smaller ones to impose a surcharge, according to the survey. Among the 300 largest banks, 53 percent of ATMs had a fee while only 40 percent of smaller bank ATMs and 6 percent of credit union ATMs charged a fee.\n",
      "That could raise antitrust law implications if large banks banded together to impose fees and drive smaller competitors out of business, Mierzwinski charged. \"Not only are big banks using their monopoly muscle to punish consumers with higer fees, but their strategy is to use the surcharge to hurt small banks and credit unions as well,\" he said.\n",
      "Customers of small banks, which have fewer of their own ATMs, would likely have to pay a surcharge more often.\n",
      "Banks say free-market competition is functioning properly. \"Competitions is already keeping ATM pricing in check,\" the ABA said.\n",
      "The consumer group said it surveyed 860 ATMs chosen at random in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The highest rates of surcharging were in the South, with 93 percent of Texas ATMs imposing a surcharge, 95 percent in Georgia, and 88 percent in Viginia and North Carolina, the group said.\n",

      "Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms.\n",
      "\"Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organizations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets,\" Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.\n",
      "Technology and free-market competition are blurring the boundries between financial and non-financial companies, but Congress can afford to wait, Greenspan said.\n",
      "\"Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,\" he said. \"Were we to move forward, it is truly irreversible.\"\n",
      "Greenspan's position reflected an evolution of the Fed's view since February when he last testified on reforming the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. At that time, Greenspan urged caution, but backed a transitional approach allowing limited mixing.\n",
      "Since then, numerous lawmakers, small bankers and a host of interest groups, including consumer and labor organizations, have voiced opposition to allowing such combinations.\n",
      "They complained that allowing a company like Microsoft Corp. or General Motors Corp. to own a major bank would diminish competition and could bias lending decisions.\n",

      "Volcker may have set the tone when he began his remarks to the House Banking Committee by observing that he delivered almost the identical testimony at a similiar hearing in 1991.\n",
      "\"I could read that statement word-for-word and it would be totally relevant\" on most issues being discussed, he said.\n",
      "Volcker, a long-time opponent of mixing commerce and banking, pointed to recent experiences in Japan and Germany.\n",
      "\"I do not think that today many observers look to Germany or Japan for a model of an effective, innovative banking system,\" he said, \"Quite the contrary.\"\n",
      "That suited committee chairman Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, also a longtime opponent of mixing banking and commerce. Rep. Doug Bereuter, Republican of Nebraska, announced at the hearing he would oppose such combinations.  \n",
      "But advocates of legislation allowing some mixing questioned Volcker's evidence and conclusions.\n",
      "Rep. Richard Baker, who has introduced a bill to allow unlimited mixing, said banks had been permitted to combine with commercial firms for most of U.S. history.\n",
      "\"This reflects that there is no principle or meaningful distinction between commerce and finance,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n",
      "Baker noted that Bankers Trust New York Corp, where Volcker sits on the board of directors, reported a profit of $62 million last year on an equity investment in an airline, asking: \"Isn't that an investment in a commercial enterprise?\"\n",
      "\"Banks are able to hold some equity investment in the course of underwriting and in the course of merchant banking, and Bankers Trust has done so at times,\" Volcker responded. \"Had they extended beyond that, they would have one director who would protest.\"\n",
      "Banks cannot hold a controlling stake in a commercial firm, Volcker added.\n",
      "When Baker suggested that lawmakers would put similar limits on commercial holdings at consolidated financial firms, referred to as a basket approach, Volcker disagreed.  \n",
      "One bill under consideration would allow financial firms to conduct 25 percent of their business in non-financial endeavors, although legislators have also discussed basing the basket limit on total capital as opposed to business activity.\n",

      "The U.S. government is scrambling to update thousands of computer systems and software programmes that might otherwise see Jan. 1, 2000, as \"00\" and think they are operating in 1900.\n",
      "\"We are confident that all of the major systems will be fixed,\" said Sally Katzen, who is coordinating much of the repair effort from her post as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget.\n",
      "\"That is what we are setting out to do and that is what we will do,\" she pledged in an interview.\n",
      "Legislators in Congress have also taken an interest in the subject and prodded agencies into action. Most are well aware of the problem, congressional staff say, although a few slackers, including the air traffic control system, are raising concerns.\n",
      "\"Congress is sounding the alarm and will keep sounding it until this problem is solved,\" Representative Steve Horn said in an interview.\n",
      "Horn, chairman of the Government Reform Committee's Management, Information and Technology subcommittee, has taken testimony from a variety of government and private-sector experts on the year 2000 problem.\n",
      "\"I have learned that the real challenge it poses is to management,\" Horn said. \"Software experts are capable of fixing the problem, but can management understand what is at stake, make it a priority, organise a plan and allocate resources so the technical experts can do their job?\"\n",
      "The subcommittee surveyed government agencies about year 2000 awareness last year and responses to an updated survey have just come in. The latest survey found that all agencies are aware of the problem and most are ready to put the needed fixes in place, a congressional staffer said.\n",
      "Some of the agencies that people are most concerned about, the Defence Department and the Social Security Administration, appear to be in good shape and have extensive plans to fix the problem well before Dec. 31, 1999.\n",
      "At the Defence Department, \"we are treating it much as we would a computer virus,\" Assistant Secretary of Defence Emmett Paige told Horn's subcommittee.\n",
      "Although weapons systems are not set to launch automatically by computers, problems could crop up when the weapons interact with command and control systems that are operated by computers, congressional staffers explained.\n",
      "During the Gulf War, a command and control system that was scheduled to run for 12 hours began shutting down weapon systems it was in contact with after running a few hours past its deadline.\n",
      "\"That would obviously be a disaster, but they're working on it,\" said one staff member.\n",
      "Social Security is also a primary focus of concern, but for more political reasons. Millions of voters depend on their Social Security checks for meeting basic living expenses. If the checks were delayed or cancelled, Congress would probably be inundated with thousands of complaints.\n",
      "\"They started the earliest but they have a lot to do and still aren't finished,\" a staff member said. \"My sense is that they will be fine.\"\n",
      "One agency of concern, according to congressional staffers, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the country's air traffic control system and inspects commercial airplanes.\n",
      "\"The Department of Transportation is very worrisome,\" one staffer said. \"The FAA is still in the assessment phase. That's the one that's a real concern.\"\n",
      "The agency cannot give an estimate of how many lines of code it has that must be changed or how much that might cost until it completes an assessment expected by the end of May, according to Mary Powers-King, who heads the FAA's information technology effort.\n",
      "\"It's somewhat painful because no new funding has been appropriated and we're having to reprogram to absorb the activity,\" Powers-King said. \"That is a big part of the reason why we started late. We've got that figured out now and we've got to just bite the bullet.\"\n",
      "Overall, recent estimates indicate the federal government will need to spend $2.4 to $2.5 billion to identify and correct year 2000 computer problems, Katzen said. The estimate has risen slightly from about $2.3 billion a few months ago.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised to see them come another ($100 to $300 million) as we continue through the process of assessment,\" Katzen said. \"But I think that we've got it in just about the right ballpark.\"\n",
      "In a Feb. 7, 1997, report to Congress, the budget office projected that the military needed the largest portion of the money for updates. The Air Force would require $371 million, the Army $218 million, the Navy $90 million and other defence-related areas $291 million.\n",
      "Other big spenders in the report were the Treasury Department, needing $319 million, and the Veterans Administration, needing $144 million.\n",

      "The Clinton administration gave a solid boost this week to congressional efforts to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws but substantial hurdles remain, participants in the debate said.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the administration's plan to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall legal barriers separating banks from securities firms and insurance companies.\n",
      "The administration plan was due to Congress by March 31 and the nearly two-month delay had some lobbyists fearing that the administration would avoid the tangled regulatory controversies and not submit anything.\n",
      "Congress has sought to reform banking laws for more than a decade, but one interest group or another has always managed to block passage of legislation. In prior years, banks sought reform, while other financial firms opposed change.\n",
      "Recently, courts and regulators have granted banks new authority, however. That brought insurance companies and securities firms to the table to seek a level playing field.\n",
      "\"There is renewed hope that the 105th Congress will tackle this difficult issue,\" said David Farmer, lobbyist for the Alliance of American Insurers, after Rubin's speech.\n",
      "The action now shifts to the Banking committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where detailed reform measures will be drafted. Rubin will provide more details of the Clinton plan in testimony before Congress on June 3.\n",
      "House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach said this week that drafting will begin immediately after that testimony and that he wants committee action completed by mid-June.\n",
      "It is at the drafting stage where some past efforts to reform banking laws have foundered as competing interests fought over the details.\n",
      "The new administration proposal ducked one of the most contentious issues -- whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.\n",
      "Instead of taking sides, Rubin offered two alternatives. Under one plan, banks would be allowed a limited amount of commercial activity, but the largest 1,000 commercial companies could not own or be owned by banks.\n",
      "Under a second alternative, the current prohibition would be continued, but the current exception allowing savings and loans to be owned by commercial companies would also be maintained.\n",
      "Several months ago, administration officials were discussing proposals to allow nearly unlimited mixing of banking and commerce. The apparent retreat left advocates of greater mixing fuming.\n",
      "\"Their recommendation is tantamount to surrender on the issue,\" Minnesota Democrat Rep. Bruce Vento said.\n",
      "Vento and New Jersey Republican Rep. Marge Roukema introduced a bill in January that would allow banks to have a \"basket\" of commercial activity accounting for up to 25 percent of an institution's total business.\n",
      "Another blow to Vento and Roukema's efforts came Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee.\n",
      "Greenspan said Congress should eliminate Glass-Steagall now, but put off the banking and commerce issue for future review. \"Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,\" he said.\n",
      "Now the banking and commerce issue threatens to derail their backing, said bank consultant Karen Shaw Petrou, president of ISD/Shaw Inc.\n",
      "\"The administration's plan is a decent baby-step,\" Petrou said. \"But unsurprisingly, it's not the lightning bolt that transforms the debate.\"\n",
      "Securities firms and insurance companies are involved in commercial activity, but want to get into banking if banks are allowed into their fields.\n",
      "\"If you don't allow banking and commerce, then you create obstacles for non-banks,\" Petrou said. \"But somebody's twist or turn to solve that then creates another problem for someone else.\"\n",
      "Even a small percentage limit on commercial activity would accommodate the largest non-bank financial companies, according to research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released on Thursday.\n",
      "Among the seven securities firms in the Fortune 1000, plus Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., none earned much more than 5 percent of their revenue from commercial activity in 1996, the FDIC estimated.\n",
      "Only one of the five largest life and health insurers and one of the five largest property and casualty firms exceeded the 5 percent level, the FDIC said.\n",
      "Four of the 10 largest diversified financial firms would exceed the 5 percent level, however. American Express derived 9 to 14 percent of its revenue from commercial activities, for example, and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc. had 28 percent of revenues from commerce.\n",

      "Legislation to dramatically relax U.S. export restrictions on computer encoding technology moved ahead on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee approved the measure.\n",
      "The bill, known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand.\n",
      "Encryption, computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.\n",
      "The Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate, arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists.\n",
      "Representative Bob Goodlatte, the bill's author, said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached.\n",
      "\"We're very, very close in many areas,\" the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote. \"The export control issue is probably the area that we're still the furthest apart on.\"\n",
      "After the votes, administration officials emphasised the differences. Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said the administration \"is disappointed that the committee acted precipitously. The bill contains serious deficiencies.\"\n",
      "Goodlatte's bill also would write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.\n",
      "The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony.\n",
      "Software industry officials and privacy advocates, who have strongly opposed the export limits, urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward.\n",
      "The International Relations Committee \"will have a go at it but it's great to have some momentum,\" Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter told Reuters after the vote. \"We've come a long way in a very short period of time. This legislation is moving at Internet time.\"\n",
      "Jonah Seiger, communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology, said the vote was a \"historic moment.\"\n",
      "\"The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction,\" Seiger said.\n",
      "Before the vote, committee chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section. Hyde said the export section fell under the jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee.\n",

      "Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined on Wednesday the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses, eliminating 60-year-old legal barriers enacted during the Great Depression.\n",
      "\"The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "The plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said in a speech at the Exchequer Club here.\n",
      "The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. \"We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach welcomed the plan, but said some substantive issues were unresolved.\n",
      "\"While differences of judgment on several key legislative points remain, Secretary Rubin's statement today is very constructive to the process,\" the Iowa Republican said.\n",
      "Industry participants said the administration plan would give the reform effort a needed boost.\n",
      "The proposal \"should provide considerable momentum for long-needed reform,\" Bankers Trust New York Corp. Chairman Frank Newman said. Newman gave the effort some prior momentum last month, when his bank took advantage of recent regulatory changes and acquired the securities firm Alex. Brown Inc.\n",
      "Consumer advocates, however, complained that the proposal did not contain adequate measures to protect bank customers buying insurance.\n",
      "\"We're very disappointed that there are no protections on insurance,\" Mary Griffin of Consumers Union said. Banks have a weak track record in that area, she added.\n",
      "Credit insurance on mortgages, the second most popular insurance product sold by banks, \"is one of the biggest consumer rip-offs out there,\" she said.\n",
      "The Rubin proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.\n",
      "\"Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,\" Rubin said.\n",
      "Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.\n",
      "Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.\n",
      "Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with commercial firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merger of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Alex. Brown Inc. sends a clear signal to Congress that the nation's banking laws enacted amid the Depression have fallen hopelessly behind market trends.\n",
      "\"It's another example of the kind of progress that is being made in the market,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, president of the consulting firm ISD/Shaw. \"The industry is modernising even if Congress is lagging on modernisation legislation.\"\n",
      "Legislators have argued for more than a decade about repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 -- enacted in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 -- which prohibits banks from offering other financial services like securities or insurance.\n",
      "The debate is still raging in Congress, but this time around the market may exert more influence. In the last year, federal courts and bank regulators have substantially diminished Glass-Steagall's reach.\n",
      "\"This is the most profound example that Glass Steagall is no longer on life-support systems; it's dead,\" said Larry LaRocco, a bank industry lobbyist and former congressman. \"Now we need to move on and deal with the other issues.\"\n",
      "One of the biggest controversies to be addressed is whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial commercial firms, said LaRocco, who is managing director at the American Bankers Association's Securities Association.\n",
      "Bankers Trust said Sunday it would acquire Baltimore-based Alex. Brown in a stock deal valued at $1.7 billion.\n",
      "In acquiring Alex. Brown, Bankers Trust was taking advantage of a move by the Federal Reserve last December to more than double the amount of revenue a bank securities subsidiary could earn without running afoul of Glass-Steagall's Section 20.\n",
      "Bankers Trust Chief Executive Officer Frank Newman told reporters Monday that after the acquisition securities activity would constitute about 20 percent of revenues on a pro forma, or estimated, basis. That would have exceeded the previous cap of 10 percent but is permissable under the revised 25 percent cap.\n",
      "Section 20 says a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company may not be \"principally engaged\" in non-permitted securities activity. Since 1987, the Fed has interpreted that to allow bank subsidiaries to do a limited amount of dealing and underwriting in a wide range of securities, including corporate stocks and bonds.\n",
      "The law already permitted banks to deal in certain kinds of securities such as Treasury bonds and general obligation municipal bonds.\n",
      "Initially, the Fed ruled that a subsidiary that derived less than 5 percent of its revenue from securities was permissible. In 1989, the cap was raised to 10 percent and in December the cap was raised to 25 percent effective March 6.\n",
      "Fed officials declined to comment on the merger.\n",
      "The merger also benefited from Fed actions to eliminate previously required barriers, known as firewalls, separating a bank from its securities subsidiary.\n",
      "\"While the deal wouldn't have been do-able at all without the revenue limit change, from a profitability standpoint the changes in the firewalls that have been made and have been announced are quite important as well,\" consultant Petrou said.\n",
      "Removing the firewalls allowed banks to cut costs by eliminating duplication between the two activities while allowing additional benefits from the combination.\n",
      "The relaxation of firewalls has drawn some criticism from Congress, where Sen. Lauch Faircloth, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's Financial Institutions subcommittee, held a hearing questioning the move.\n",
      "But the North Carolina Republican now seems satisfied with most of what the Fed has done or proposed. \"We're going to entrust to the Fed that they'll continue to do the prudent thing,\" Faircloth's legislative director James Hyland said.\n",
      "Faircloth's remaining concerns centre on two of the 28 firewall reforms proposed by the Fed in January, allowing a bank to buy investments underwritten by its securities firm for its own trust accounts and lending money to an investor to purchase underwritten securities, Hyland said.\n",

      "The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks, industry officials said Monday.\n",
      "The administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3, but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week, the officials said.\n",
      "Under Secretary John Hawke, a leading architect of the administration plan, is slated to speak here on Wednesday. In his speech, Hawke may indicate the administration's stand on mixing banking and commerce, lobbyists said.\n",
      "\"Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin,\" one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. \"But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.\"\n",
      "While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.\n",
      "The administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.\n",
      "But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labour and consumer groups.\n",
      "And during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.\n",
      "Bowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favour allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a \"basket\" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.\n",
      "But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.\n",
      "Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.\n",
      "Almost everyone favours \"functional regulation,\" meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.\n",
      "But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.\n",
      "While some favour setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap, the administration is expected to back a committee approach. The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators.\n",

      "Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.\n",
      "Once the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.\n",
      "This year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\n",
      "The new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed. But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.\n",
      "The government says it needs the ability to crack strong encryption to catch criminals and terrorists.\n",
      "While a few companies, most notably International Business Machines, have obtained export licenses under the new policy, most high-tech companies remain frustrated.  \n",
      "They want to be able to export very strong encryption without including the government access features.\n",
      "Privacy advocates also oppose the current Clinton policy, which they say puts too much power in the hands of government.\n",
      "Since the government does not require guaranteed access to the keys to one's home, it should not be given such access to the keys to one's data, they argue. \"My lock, my key,\" is the slogan on their buttons this week.\n",
      "In congress, the passage of time has crystallized the issue for many members and both sides in the debate have found new allies. Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favor of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.\n",
      "The full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.\n",
      "While the list of supporters of the bills has grown, some outspoken opponents have surfaced for the first time.\n",
      "Sen Bob Kerrey made a statement on the Senate floor March 3 opposing the Senate bills.  \n",

      "There may be many more places to hang your hat in cyberspace soon, thanks to a plan adopted by the Internet Society and a host of other groups, the society announced Tuesday.\n",
      "But while some major Internet companies immediately endorsed the plan, online services providers gave it a cool reception.\n",
      "The Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, said the plan would provide seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address.\n",
      "New domain names such as \"firm,\" \"arts,\" and \"web\" will be added to existing top-level domains such as \"com,\" \"net,\" and \"org\" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said.\n",
      "Computer maker Digital Equipment Corp., telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc., endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February, the society said.\n",
      "But America Online Inc., the largest online service in the world with more than 8 million members, said some details still needed to be worked out.\n",
      "\"We are still studying the proposal,\" said William Burrington, director of law and public policy at America Online. While praising the plan's concept, Burrington said he thought \"it still needs some more work.\" The company hopes to craft a better plan \"that is more saleable,\" he added.\n",
      "The largest \"pure Internet\" service provider, AT&amp;T Corp.'s Worldnet service, was equally unenthusiastic. \"We are still looking at these domain names,\" spokesman Mike Miller said. \"We are studying them.\"\n",
      "The plan also has been endorsed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards operating under a charter from the society and the Federal Network Council.\n",
      "The plan also establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.\n",
      "Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address \"candyland.com,\" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name.\n",
      "\"Responsible self-governance is the key factor in assuring that the Internet will reach its fullest potential,\" Internet Society President Donald Heath said.\n",
      "Although other groups have tried to establish alternate domain names, they have not succeeded in persuading the vast majority of Internet service providers to add their new names to the computers that route information across the network.\n",
      "The Internet Society plan better meets the needs of major providers, supporters said.\n",
      "\"The Internet is growing up rapidly and it is vital that the processes, procedures and policies that define its adminstration be sound, stable and sustainable in an international setting,\" MCI Senior Vice President Vincent Cerf said.\n",
      "MCI is a top operator of the Internet's backbone network.\n",
      "Currently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen.\n",
      "But Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net.\n",
      "\"This plan risks the stability of the Internet,\" he said.\n",
      "The current system functions \"pretty well\" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times.\n",

      "China's major state banks reported profits last year -- some sharply higher than in 1995 -- and analysts said on Monday this showed they were beginning to act like commercial banks elsewhere.\n",
      "Fees from credit cards and electronic banking services were drawing in new income while loans were being extended with greater care in limiting risk, they said.\n",
      "However, the results probably disguised the banking system's huge pile of bad debts from past loans, and writeoffs -- either by the banks or the state itself -- were likely in the years ahead, they said.\n",
      "\"The big banks are gradually being turned into real commercial banks and making loans on a commercial basis,\" said an official at the Industrial and Commercial Bank in Shenzhen.\n",
      "\"There is a gradual reduction in (lending) risk,\" he said, adding that banks were also cutting costs through electronic payment systems and looking for new sources of income.\n",
      "That view was shared by other Chinese bankers.\n",
      "\"There are more controls on lending throughout the banking system,\" said an official with the Everbright Bank.\n",
      "China's banks once were viewed more as the financial arm of the government, extending loans to enterprises that needed funds regardless of whether they would ever repay.\n",
      "Banks are now encouraged to make loans that will return a profit while state development banks have been set up to help sectors seen as vital to government interests.\n",
      "The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -- the bank with the widest exposure in domestic industry -- said its profits surged to 14.5 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) last year from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995.\n",
      "The Bank of China earned 8.2 billion yuan and the China Construction Bank made 2.76 billion yuan, although neither gave comparative figures. The Agricultural Bank said it had a sharp rise in rise in profits in percentage terms.\n",
      "Bankers said the removal of an interest rate subsidy on long-term deposits and two interest rate cuts during the year fuelled bank profits.\n",
      "The rate cuts not only helped ailing state companies to repay loans that had already been extended but they widened the spread between the cost of funds and the interest earned on loans.\n",
      "\"The spread has widened to about three percentage points from less than one point,\" said Beijing University economist Xiao Zhuoji.\n",
      "\"This has also helped the state banks.\"\n",
      "But foreign financial specialists said there was still a relatively low return on assets and one of the key concerns was the extent of the bad loans of the past.\n",
      "\"No one really knows the extent of the bad debts in the banking system,\" said a foreign financial specialist in Beijing.\n",
      "The U.S. based rating agency Moody's Investors Service said in a report at the weekend that the banks would be insolvent if their loan values were written down to reflect repayment problems, but resolution of the issue would require a complete restructuring of state industry and recapitalistion of the banks.\n",
      "($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n",

      "China may need to adjust the mix of its treasury debt next year to ensure an active response from domestic institutions, analysts said on Friday.\n",
      "Finance ministry officials were meeting in Beijing on Friday to discuss bond market trends and the issue of China's debt mix could be a focus of the talks, the analysts said.\n",
      "\"There is too much of the non-tradeable type of debt,\" said a Shenzhen analyst. \"It is not really attractive to institutions or individual investors.\"\n",
      "China is issuing about 250 billion yuan ($30.1 billion) of state debt this year -- most of it domestic. More than half of the total is for non-tradeable voucher or certificate type treasury debt.\n",
      "In return for their funds, investors receive a certificate that can be redeemed before maturity. But this type of debt is not listed on either of the nation's stock exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen and no active secondary trading exists.\n",
      "Last year, this non-tradeable type of debt accounted for only about one-tenth of total government debt issued, bond traders said.\n",
      "\"Last year the focus was on the secondary market,\" said a trader with J&amp;A Securities in Shenzhen. \"Most of the debt was tradeable on the nation's exchanges.\"\n",
      "Other securities firms agreed the response so far this year had been less than enthusiastic.\n",
      "\"There is not that much interest in the (non-tradeable) offer this year,\" said an official at China Southern Securities. \"I am not very optimistic about the outcome.\"\n",
      "A Finance Ministry official denied there were problems with the sales, which began on March 1.\n",
      "\"I am satisfied with the outcome so far,\" the official told Reuters. \"We have until October to complete the sales.\"\n",
      "The bonds are offered through bank underwriting syndicates, and analysts said that if the banks have to keep too much of the debt on their own books, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about next year's issue.\n",
      "The trend was particularly marked in southern China where economic development has outpaced the rest of the country, giving investors more types of investment vehicles to choose from.\n",
      "An official at the state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shenzhen branch described the response to the offer in the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong as poor.\n",
      "Some analysts said the problem lay elsewhere. \"The interest rate is the real problem,\" said Zhao Xiaoyun, an analyst at China Securities Co.\n",
      "Zhao said bond interest rates were unable to match the returns available on the stock market. Domestic A shares in Shanghai have gained 40 percent since the start of the year.\n",
      "The 1997 state offer includes two-, three- and five-year debt carrying interest of 8.64 percent, 9.18 percent and 10.17 percent. This is 0.72, 0.92 and 1.17 percentage points higher than the interest paid on bank time deposits of corresponding periods.\n",
      "In the recent past, interest on bonds has been 1.5 to two percentage points higher than equivalent bank rates. But analysts said China may not want to widen the spread between time deposits and bonds too much. The banks may underwrite the debt but they are not eager to see their deposits drawn away by higher interest bonds.\n",
      "That could mean the best option for the state is to issue debt that can be traded and attracts institutional investors.\n",

      "China's President Jiang Zemin used his eulogy for Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday to hail the late leader's guidance in the recovery of Hong Kong and pledge peaceful reunification with Taiwan.\n",
      "Jiang told 10,000 Communist Party luminaries and other guests at the funeral rites for the late leader that Deng's great creation was the \"one country, two systems\" formula of allowing capitalist and socialist systems to coexist side by side in one country.\n",
      "\"The complete reunification of our motherland is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese nation,\" said Jiang, Deng's hand-picked successor, in a speech delivered at Beijing's Great Hall of the People and televised around the country.\n",
      "\"Using the formula of 'one country, two systems' to realise peaceful reunification is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great creation,\" he said.\n",
      "Deng guided the negotiations with Britain that eventually led to a 1984 accord under which the colony is to be returned to Chinese rule at midnight next June 30.\n",
      "Under that agreement, Beijing pledges to allow the colony to retain its capitalist system and a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years.\n",
      "The nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to China in 1999, leaving Nationalist Chinese-ruled Taiwan as the last territory Beijing must recover to achieve its dream of reunification.\n",
      "Deng died last Wednesday before seeing the recovery of any of these territories but Jiang said the Communist Party should carry out the late leader's mission.\n",
      "\"We must act in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, striving to attain the objective of the motherland's reunification,\" Jiang said, speaking in front of a huge portrait of Deng draped in black ribbons and surrounded by bouquets of flowers.\n",
      "\"In accordance with the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese agreements, Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland soon and Macao will return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999,\" he said.\n",
      "\"The Taiwan question will be settled eventually and the complete reunification of the motherland will certainly be achieved,\" he said confidently.\n",
      "Among the invited guests in the cavernous auditorium were supporters of Beijing from Hong Kong and Macau, most of them prominent businessmen, as well as Tung Chee-hwa who has been chosen to take over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1.\n",
      "Despite its pledge of autonomy for Hong Kong, Beijing has already decided to scrap some civil liberties and replace the territory's elected legislature with an appointed one after the transfer of power.\n",
      "That has raised concerns in Hong Kong as well as the United States and Britain.\n",
      "Taiwan, which has been separated from China since the end of a civil war in 1949, says it too wants to reunify with the mainland but under very different terms than those offered by Beijing.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Chinese ideologue known for his strictly orthodox Marxist views denied on Tuesday that he was the author of two essays critical of China's reforms.\n",
      "Deng Liqun, 81, a former Communist Party propaganda chief and secretary to Chairman Mao Zedong, said the author of two articles that have become known as \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" was Li Yanming.\n",
      "\"I didn't write the essay, it was Li Yanming,\" Deng told reporters. He did not further identify Li Yanming and gave no Asked whether he supported Li's views in \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" that has sparked widespread behind-the-scenes debate, he smiled and shrugged and said: \"He wrote what was on his mind.\"\n",
      "Deng was attending an economic summit in Beijing that was assessing the business climate in China, with a heavy emphasis on the successes of the reform programme launched in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping to eliminate stultifying Stalinist-style planning in favour of market forces.\n",
      "Asked if he agreed with issues under debate at the conference, Deng adopted the officially-sanctioned public party line: \"Of course. China is a very big country, it has a lot of potential but it also has a lot of problems to be solved.\"\n",
      "Several of the speakers at the conference called for tougher efforts to reform China's ailing state-owned enterprises, which \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" warns are suffering at the expense of private enterprise.\n",
      "China's propaganda tsars recently suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on the essay erupted into the public eye.\n",
      "The ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.\n",
      "The Press and Publications Administration, under the party's powerful Propaganda Department, suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in southwestern Guizhou province, in August, said sources familiar with the magazine.\n",
      "The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of the privately circulated 10,000-word essay, which also urges a return to the class struggle espoused by Mao.\n",
      "Western diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.\n",
      "The president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor.\n",
      "The clampdown has been fuelled by a call for \"spiritual civilisation\" -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month, the analysts said.\n",
      "Party chief Jiang is said to have distanced himself from the essay at the annual session of the National People's Congress, or parliament, last March, when he reportedly said: \"Some people say I support the 10,000-word essay, isn't that underestimating me too much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A top Chinese official for contacts with Taiwan ruled out an early resumption of talks on reunification because the island's leaders were pursuing \"splittist\" policies, the China Daily said on Tuesday.\n",
      "It also quoted Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), as saying that Taiwanese authorities did not want the handover of Hong Kong to go smoothly and might try to disrupt the transfer of power.\n",
      "\"In the long term the mainland and Taiwan should sit down at the negotiating table to discuss cross-straits issues under the 'one-China' policy,\" Tang was quoted as saying.\n",
      "But he said the atmosphere for talks would not improve in the short term unless Taiwan's leaders, including its \"so-called\" President Lee Teng-hui, halted their \"splittist\" activities aimed at independence for the island.\n",
      "China and Taiwan have been rivals since the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949.\n",
      "Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to isolate it diplomatically.\n",
      "Talks between the two sides were broken off after President Lee made a landmark private visit to the United States in mid-1995, enraging Beijing.\n",
      "\"We have the patience to handle the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland,\" Tang said.\n",
      "The newspaper also said Taiwan authorities would likely take measures to reduce the impact on the island from the success of China's policies towards Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing sovereignty on July 1 after 150 years of British rule.\n",
      "\"According to Tang, there is information that Taiwan forces in Hong Kong are planning to cause trouble, such as demonstrations around July 1, when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory,\" the newspaper said.\n",
      "Tang also repeated Beijing's long-held stance that the United States should halt arms sales to Taiwan.\n",
      "The Chinese official's remarks were published by the English language newspaper as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was visiting Taiwan.\n",
      "Beijing insists the 1989 winner of the Nobel Peace prize is waging a campaign for independence for Tibet.\n",
      "Tang made no mention of Beijing's announcement last week that it would return a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a Taiwan passenger jet to mainland China.\n",
      "Beijing wants Taiwan to return Chinese hijackers now in Taiwanese jails but so far it has been disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Premier Li Peng said on Friday China wanted a swift end to a crisis surrounding a senior North Korean defector sheltering in South Korea's mission in Beijing.\n",
      "Li gave little hint as to how the month-long standoff would end, although he said stability on the tense Korean peninsula was a key consideration.\n",
      "\"I can tell you conditions are nearly ripe for solving this problem,\" Li told reporters when asked about progress in negotiations on the fate of Hwang Jang-yop, who has sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing consulate.\n",
      "China wanted to \"appropriately solve this problem at an early date\", he told a news conference at Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.\n",
      "\"On this question, China will exercise caution and we will handle the issue by proceeding from the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula,\" Li said.\n",
      "\"Of course, we will consider the positions of all sides,\" he said.\n",
      "Hwang, a senior ideological theoretician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while China and North and South Korea negotiate his fate.\n",
      "He is the most senior official to defect from the isolated Stalinist state.\n",
      "He has said he wants to be allowed to go to South Korea and foreign diplomats have said that he would likely be allowed to leave for a third country first and then travel to Seoul.\n",
      "The defection on Chinese territory has deeply embarrassed Beijing, forcing it to chose between its old communist ally of North Korea and its new capitalist friend in the South.\n",
      "China and North Korea fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean War but Beijing has drawn closer to South Korea as it pushes ahead with rapid development under market-style economic reforms.\n",
      "Li repeated Beijing's position that it had jurisdiction since Hwang asked for asylum while he was in Beijing.\n",
      "He said China would follow international practice in solving the dispute but he made the somewhat surprising remark that there was no automatic right to asylum as far as Beijing was concerned.\n",
      "\"China does not recognise the right of diplomatic asylum by foreign embassies or consulates in its territory,\" he said.\n",
      "Beijing has, however, allowed asylum seekers to leave foreign embassies on its soil in the past.\n",
      "Dissident Fang Lizhi sought shelter in the U.S. embassy in Beijing shortly after the army crackdown on dissent in June 1989. He was eventually allowed to leave for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "China has begun shipping corn from key growing areas in the north to other parts of the country, cutting northern stockpiles in a bid to keep weak prices there from falling further.\n",
      "However, domestic corn prices, already under pressure, were likely to extend their slide, industry officials said on Tuesday.\n",
      "Officials said last week that permission had been given to ship 1.5 million tonnes of corn from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces to other parts of the country.\n",
      "The government hopes to push up prices in growing regions to benefit farmers, analysts said. Farmers usually sell their crop close to where it was grown to a middleman, normally a state company, they said.\n",
      "Some shipments had already begun, officials said.\n",
      "\"These shipments should not have too much of an effect on prices,\" said an official at the information centre of the State Grain Reserve Administration.\n",
      "\"Overall there is excess supply and the price of corn is expected to remain under pressure this year,\" he said, adding that weak demand from the domestic feed industry is also contributing to sluggish prices.\n",
      "Heilongjiang provincial grain authorities told Reuters by telephone there had been little impact so far on prices in the region.\n",
      "Domestic corn prices have slid more than 30 percent since early last year.\n",
      "Two years of bumper harvests and curbs on exports have led to rising stockpiles and falling prices.\n",
      "China has estimated its corn output at 118.5 million tonnes in 1996, up from 106 million in 1995.\n",
      "The China Grains, Oils and feeds newsletter has projected corn production at 122.5 million tonnes this year.\n",
      "China has made public figures of its overall grain reserves but it has not given a breakdown of specific crops.\n",
      "The domestic media have said stockpiles were forcing the state to look for additional space to store excess grain.\n",
      "The China Grains, Oils and Feeds newsletter said market prices in Jilin and Heilongjiang were 1,130 yuan ($136) and 1,050 yuan per tonne, though some analysts say that prices have fallen through the 1,000-yuan level.\n",
      "Prices had been around 1,300 to 1,400 yuan per tonne last spring, they said.\n",
      "Analysts said that despite the downward pressure on prices, China was unlikely to remove its controls on exports -- which were imposed in December 1994 on fears of domestic shortages and inflationary pressure.\n",
      "\"The main concern is still inflation,\" an analyst said. Even the potential windfall from large-scale exports would not be enough to justify abandoning checks on inflation, although inflation remained largely under control, he added.\n",
      "The State Grain Reserve Administration official agreed.\n",
      "\"We are not really looking to make money at this,\" he said in a reference to exports. \"We are just making some small adjustments in the overall picture.\"\n",
      "China exported 150,000 tonnes of corn in the first 11 months of last year, up 36.2 percent from the same period of 1995. The 1995 figures were well below the previous year levels.\n",
      "A farm analyst said China's prices were still substantially above world levels and unlikely to interest buyers, even if Beijing decided to relax its stance on exports.\n",
      "\"We won't see more than one million tonnes out of China this year,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's central bank, stung by the collapse of a major trust company, is looking warily at the nation's financial system, warning of dangers to Beijing's prestige and social stability.\n",
      "The failure of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of \"serious illegal and irregular practices\" was deeply embarrassing for China's financial regulators, bankers said.\n",
      "But it was a vindication of sorts for those who have been trying to make the People's Bank of China more like its Western counterparts, boosting the central bank's ability to detect problems in the financial sector, they said.\n",
      "That eventually could help to give it more independence from the nation's political decision-makers, bankers said.\n",
      "Under a three-year, World Bank-sponsored programme, the central bank enlisted the help of big accounting firm Price Waterhouse to strengthen its accounting and supervisory abilities.\n",
      "\"They (central bank officials) recognised they had to improve the quality of the information they had,\" said J. Thomas Macy, who headed up the Price Waterhouse team working with the central bank.\n",
      "\"You can't make good decisions if you don't have good data,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n",
      "LOANS OFTEN NOT REPAID\n",
      "The People's Bank of China was once seen as merely the financial arm of the government, ensuring that money allocated for lending went to the right place. Whether borrowers ever repaid was less important.\n",
      "China's four, main state-run banks have a combined 134,000 branches and each branch reported to the central bank independently. That gave the central bank a huge flow of uncoordinated and often not very useful information.\n",
      "A Western diplomat who viewed such reports piled up at the central bank said he asked a bank employee several years ago what the central bank did with the data and was told earnestly: \"We add the numbers up.\"\n",
      "\"The data gave no idea of the state of health of the financial system,\" said Price Waterhouse's Macy.\n",
      "That is clearly changing.\n",
      "A computer system was designed for the bank's reporting purposes and a risk-based aproach to financial examination is being introduced.\n",
      "Macy said an 800-page examination manual would be given to some 10,000 bank examiners.\n",
      "CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENS GRIP ON SECTOR\n",
      "Chinese bankers say the central bank is already tightening its grip on the financial system.\n",
      "\"They are checking much more closely now,\" said a Chinese banker in Shenzhen near Hong Kong. \"They are keeping a close eye on the commercial banks.\"\n",
      "Many foreign bankers agree there has been a marked change.\n",
      "\"The data collected is getting much better,\" said a Japanese banker.\n",
      "\"But more work on technical inspections is needed to bring them (central bank operations) up to international levels,\" he said.\n",
      "Others argue that such skills are not learned overnight.\n",
      "Bankers said problems similar to those that forced the closure of CADTIC this month still lurk elsewhere in the financial sector. Smaller trust companies set up by regional or local governments are particularly vulnerable.\n",
      "CENTRAL BANK SOUNDS ALARM BUT LACKS INDEPENDENCE\n",
      "Central bankers have been sounding the alarm over financial risk, bringing up the theme repeatedly at a recent national banking conference.\n",
      "They pushed home the need for a separation of trust companies -- like CADTIC -- from banks so that banks and their depositors would be insulated from problems at trust firms.\n",
      "They also made their case for keeping bank funds out of the volatile stock and futures markets.\n",
      "If the central bank can demonstrate that it has taken charge of financial supervision it might find it has more room to manoeuvre in the policy-making area, bankers said.\n",
      "Economic issues such as money supply targets -- or even the decision to let foreign banks conduct local currency business -- are highly politicised in China. The central bank ultimately must listen to the views of the State Council, or cabinet.\n",
      "While this may be politically necessary now, bankers said they would like to see the government give the central bank a vote of confidence by granting it more decision-making authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting to members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday in a campaign aimed at boosting ties with the American Congress.\n",
      "A beaming Jiang was shown on state television receiving the 22 representatives -- the biggest U.S. congressional delegation ever to visit China.\n",
      "\"Improving Sino-U.S. relations and developing them on a healthy basis is in the interests of both countries,\" he said. \"I had very good discussions with President (Bill) Clinton in Manila in November and we reached some important understandings.\n",
      "\"The Chinese side is willing to grasp the present opportunities and, along with the United States, to reduce difficulties between our two countries.\"\n",
      "Beijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the past two years ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.\n",
      "In Manila, Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998 that would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989.\n",
      "Analysts said China's communist leadership -- and Jiang in particular -- were eager to boost ties with the Congress, fearing that Beijing had suffered by relying too heavily on its links to the U.S. administration in the past.\n",
      "They noted that the Beijing believes it was led astray by administration assurances that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be permitted to visit the United States in 1995.\n",
      "Congress pushed hard for Lee and the landmark private visit was eventually allowed to proceed, a decision that enraged Beijing.\n",
      "China turned its anger on the island, which it considers a rebel province, first breaking off a semi-official channel for talks with Taipei and later holding missile tests near the island in March last year.\n",
      "Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who is leading the congressional delegation, told reporters shortly before his meeting with Jiang on Tuesday that Chinese leaders had recognised the need for contacts with Congress.\n",
      "\"The Chinese are becoming much more skilled and have much more contact\" with Congress, he said.\n",
      "Members of the congressional group told reporters that human rights had come up in discussions with other Chinese officials and would be raised during the meeting with Jiang.\n",
      "Jiang met a U.S. Senate group led by minority leader Tom Daschle last November.\n",
      "Jiang, who is known to be fond of Western pop songs, was said to have entertained that group with some of his repertoire. It was unknown if the Kolbe delegation would be treated to the same welcome.\n",

      "China's stock regulators are trying to reassert control over what they see as backdoor listings of Chinese companies in Hong Kong, market sources said on Thursday.\n",
      "They said the new concerns were triggered by the listing this week of GITIC Enterprises, a Hong Kong company that is controlled indirectly by the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp (GITIC), based in the south China city of Guangzhou.\n",
      "They said the problem was particularly sensitive because of the territory's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 under a Sino-British accord that promises a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of political power.\n",
      "\"The (Chinese) authorities are certainly worried about this issue and we could see some guidelines emerge before too long,\" said a securities industry executive.\n",
      "A foreign securities company executive agreed.\n",
      "\"China is worried that a number of good companies will inject mainland assets into Hong Kong companies and then take them public without their approval.\"\n",
      "Chinese companies that wish to list shares abroad, usually in Hong Kong, need clearance from a number of central government regulatory bodies, including the watchdog agency, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).\n",
      "Rules for Hong Kong companies controlled by Chinese interests are less clear, but recently many of these firms have first gained approval from Beijing.\n",
      "GITIC Enterprises did not get prior clearance and regulatory objections are believed to have presented a last-minute hurdle.\n",
      "The offer was allowed to proceed, however, and was a stunning success. The issue, nearly 900 times subscribed, finished its first day of trading on Wednesday at HK$4.375 compared with its offer price of HK$1.05.\n",
      "\"The company is listed now so there is no need to address the issue of whether the CSRC was involved,\" said an official of parent company GITIC, speaking by telephone from Guangzhou.\n",
      "At least two more Hong Kong-registered companies controlled by Chinese firms from Beijing and Tianjin were preparing to offer shares in Hong Kong. They were likely to wait for Chinese regulatory clearance, sources said.\n",
      "Another Guangdong company has postponed plans for an offer of shares by a Hong Kong company it controls because of the latest developments, said sources in Beijing and Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"The problem is mainly with Guangdong province,\" said a regulator in Beijing.\n",
      "Guangdong, far from the reach of authorities in Beijing and backed by considerable financial muscle, has often been at odds with central government directives.\n",
      "The scope of control over Hong Kong is even more sensitive.\n",
      "The CSRC and other financial regulators have repeatedly said they would not interfere in supervisory matters in Hong Kong, in keeping with Beijing's promises for the territory after the handover.\n",
      "An official at the CSRC was unable to clarify the extent of the agency's regulatory powers on this issue.\n",
      "\"I can't comment,\" said the official. \"It is too sensitive.\"\n",
      "Securities regulators in Guangdong underscored the problem of reaching agreement on the issue.\n",
      "\"When a company seeks permission from the CSRC we are usually aware of it,\" said a provincial regulatory official.\n",

      "China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.\n",
      "Some economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.\n",
      "\"This is better than expected,\" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.\n",
      "\"We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,\" he told Reuters. The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.\n",
      "China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\n",
      "China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.\n",
      "The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.\n",
      "Chen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.\n",
      "What China officially refers to as \"appropriately tight\" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.\n",
      "\"The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,\" he said.\n",
      "China has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.\n",
      "After adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.\n",
      "\"The key has been control over fixed asset investment,\" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",
      "Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.\n",
      "Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.\n",
      "Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.\n",
      "But Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.\n",

      "\"... if they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,\" he said.\n",

      "China has said it will scrap Hong Kong's existing elected Legislative Council and install an appointed provisional body in a move opposed by Britain as well as the United States.\n",
      "Qian, who is also a vice-premier, conceded that foreign countries had commercial interests in Hong Kong but that did not give them the right to inferfere in the territory's affairs after the handover.\n",
      "\"No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\" he said, repeating Beijing's long-standing position.\n",
      "Qian also held out the prospect of legislators who lost seats in Hong Kong being able to run for posts in China's parliament, the National People's Congress.\n",
      "He said, however, they would have to recognise the Chinese constitution and accept China's procedures for choosing delegates.\n",
      "China's parliament has little real power and its main task is to approve laws drafted by the Communist Party.\n",

      "U.S. investigators had found what officials called conclusive evidence that Chinese government funds were funnelled into the United States in 1996, the newspaper said.\n",
      "China and the United States have been hoping to use Gore's visit, scheduled for March 24-28, to help restore ties strained in recent years by a host of issues ranging from Taiwan and trade to arms and human rights.\n",
      "Gore would become the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-President George Bush toured Beijing in early 1989. That trip was marred by a flap over a U.S. decision to invite a prominent dissident to a banquet in honour of China's leaders.\n",
      "Chinese and American officials have given few details of Gore's trip, though an advance team is expected in Beijing this week to make final preparations.\n",

      "\"We do not have the money to support U.S. political parties,\" a ministry spokesman told reporters on Tuesday.\n",
      "A U.S. congressional committee investigating campaign funding abuses has issued subpoenas to the White House and Justice Department for information on any alleged Chinese government involvement in funnelling money for the 1996 U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "A senior Chinese foreign ministry official had made serious representations to the U.S. charge d'affairs in Beijing over the accusations of illegal donations, the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.\n",

      "\"I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.\"\n",
      "Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.\n",
      "One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.\n",
      "Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.\n",
      "Trading in some of those issues has not been active.\n",

      "One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.\n",
      "Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.\n",

      "The report concluded that the failure of the Long March 3B was due to an electrical problem in the power module of the \"inertial platform\" that operated the rocket's direction controls.\n",
      "\"There was no electric current output from the power module in the servo-loop on the follow-up frame of the inertia platform,\" a spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corp, which handles China's launches, quoted the report as saying.\n",

      "The latest report said the rocket smashed into a hillside 1.85 km (1.2 miles) from the launch site.\n",
      "Official reports said six people were killed and 57 injured, although a video smuggled out by an Israeli scientist showed extensive damage to buildings in the area, suggesting that the number of casualties might have been considerably higher.\n",
      "The final report said that because of the severity of the explosion, no large pieces of wreckage of the satellite or the rocket remained.\n",
      "The report's conclusions were drawn largely from film of the launch and data from remote testing.\n",
      "China's space programme once had a reputation for dependability, but has been marred by a string of recent failures.\n",
      "It suffered a blow to its hopes to capture a significant share of the commercial satellite launch market when a Long March 3 rocket failed to lift a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit last month.\n",
      "The preliminary conclusion blamed the failure on a problem with the third-stage booster of the Long March 3 rocket, which is supposed to be one of China's most reliable launch vehicles.\n",
      "China has come under pressure from potential foreign customers as well as the insurance industry to disclose more information on the problems with its launches so far.\n",

      "China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\n",
      "China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.\n",
      "The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.\n",
      "Chen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.\n",
      "What China officially refers to as \"appropriately tight\" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.\n",
      "\"The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,\" he said.\n",
      "China has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.\n",
      "After adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.\n",
      "\"The key has been control over fixed asset investment,\" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",
      "Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.\n",
      "Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.\n",
      "Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.\n",

      "U.S. computer software giant Microsoft Corp joined China's top personal computer maker on Tuesday in a licensing pact hailed by Beijing as proof it was serious about protecting intellectual property rights.\n",
      "Under the agreement, China's Legend Group will be allowed to pre-install the Chinese-language version of Microsoft's Windows 95 software in its personal computers.\n",
      "\"This shows the Chinese government's resolve to protect intellectual property rights,\" said Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer at the Ministry of Electronics Industry, speaking at the signing ceremony in Beijing.\n",
      "Other officials at the ceremony described the accord as one of the biggest signed since the United States and China reached an agreement last June on the protection of intellectual property rights, averting a trade war.\n",
      "Beijing agreed to protect intellectual property rights by moving to stamp out piracy that American firms had alleged was costing them $2.3 billion a year in lost sales.\n",
      "Computer software piracy figured prominently in last year's often heated Sino-U.S. discussions.\n",
      "The licensing pact could mean payments of about 100 million yuan ($12 million) by Legend to Microsoft over the next two years, if the Chinese company meets its sales targets, officials of the two companies said.\n",
      "Legend said it sold 200,000 personal computers last year and it is aiming to double that figure this year.\n",
      "Chinese government officials have said that about 1.8 million personal computers were sold overall in China last year.\n",
      "\"This is the most significant agreement Microsoft has signed in the People's Republic of China,\" said Charles Stevens, Microsoft vice president, Far East.\n",
      "The two companies described their agreement as part of a strategic partnership that pointed to further cooperation in future.\n",
      "The Windows 95 software to be installed in the Legend computers employs the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China.\n",
      "Legend Group controls the Hong Kong-listed Legend. Legend officials said the income from the personal computers sold under the agreement with Microsoft would be largely reflected in the results of the Beijing operations.\n",

      "In China's headlong rush to develop, first in its fanatical leftwing past and then in the get-rich-quick days of reform, it has hacked or bulldozed away much of its architectural heritage.\n",
      "Graceful old courtyards of Beijing have fallen victim to the development onslaught in recent years, crumbling alongside one of the earliest casualties -- the once majestic Beijing city wall.\n",
      "Built to ward off invaders centuries ago, the wall was unable to withstand the inroads of its own people bent on discarding what was considered out of date.\n",
      "But China's capital is trying to make amends for some of its past excesses by restoring a small portion of the wall that encircled the city until it was dismantled in the years after the communist takeover in 1949.\n",
      "Residents of Beijing have been answering a public call to return city wall bricks to help rebuild a small section of the structure.\n",
      "Bricks once buried in courtyards, kept as household ornaments or used as building materials have been handed over to a group restoring the wall under the direction of the Beijing city government.\n",
      "\"We hope to have about 115 metres of the wall restored this year,\" said Li Yancheng of the Beijing Historical Relics Construction Co of the municipal government.\n",
      "MING DYNASTY KILNS\n",
      "Some 30,000 bricks from the old wall have been donated to the project and now sit stacked on a city lot where they will be used in the restoration effort.\n",

      "\"As a child I remember helping take down part of the wall,\" said Li. \"Adults were doing it so I joined in. Now I have a chance to put some of the wall back together.\"\n",
      "The wall, which stood 12 metres (39 ft) tall and 16 metres wide (52 ft) in some places, was built largely in the Ming dynasty, although some parts dated back to the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.), a period of Mongol rule.\n",
      "CITY WALL CLEARED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TIANANMEN SQUARE\n",
      "Large chunks of the wall were pulled down in the 1950s when Beijing's communist leaders created Tiananmen Square.\n",
      "More was torn down in the 1960s and 1970s for the construction of one of the city's main roads and for the subway.\n",
      "Many of the city gates were left standing, although what had been the Zhonghua Gate is now the site of the mausoleum for late revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in the centre of Tiananmen Square.\n",
      "In more recent years, market-style economic reforms have sent real estate values soaring, leading to the wholesale clearing of older buildings to make way for sleak new office towers.\n",
      "One such real estate project has led to the demolition of homes that had been built up against the wall. The outline of those homes is still visible on the section being restored.\n",
      "The redevelopment has also revealed a bomb shelter, built nearby during tension with the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and using city wall bricks.\n",
      "RETIRED SHOEMAKER ANSWERS STATE'S CALL FOR HELP\n",
      "Hai Changhai, a 71-year-old retired shoemaker, is one of the Beijing residents who answered the state's call to bring back bricks taken home when the wall was demolished.\n",
      "\"They were in our yard and weren't doing anyone much good,\" he said after pedalling his tricycle across town to make a donation. \"Now the state can make use of them.\"\n",
      "Some Beijing residents point an accusing finger at the state -- and the ruling Communist Party -- for all the destruction of the past.\n",
      "\"None of the communist leaders wanted to protect these things,\" said Dai Qing, a dissident writer who has been active in preserving historical relics. \"None of them spoke up.\"\n",
      "One of the few people who did speak out was Liang Sicheng, the head of prestigious Qinghua University's construction department in the early days of communist rule.\n",
      "\"He was very critical of the development plans,\" said Cheng Zhihua, a professor at the same department at Qinghua today.\n",
      "\"But he had little influence because the official media did not publish his views,\" said Cheng.\n",
      "What Liang had to say was dangerous then, and he was persecuted for his views during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of leftist fanaticism that began in 1965.\n",
      "Beijing officials say there is a growing awareness of the need to preserve the past. Some residents say that may be because so much of the city's heritage has already disappeared.\n",
      "Some say other factors may also play a role.\n",
      "A museum may be built near the wall when it is restored and city planners soon will have another tourist attraction.\n",

      "Citizens spilled into public places across China on Saturday to mourn the late leader Deng Xiaoping, acting spontaneously in the face of a lack of official memorial activities.\n",
      "State television has been running endless official paeans to Deng and showing formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities.\n",
      "But in China itself, and especially the capital Beijing, the state has done little to encourage public shows of mourning, leaving the citizenry to do things themselves.\n",
      "In Deng's home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province, tens of thousands of mourners have thronged to the courtyard of his birth since the community's favourite son died on Wednesday night.\n",
      "In the Sichuan capital Chengdu, people poured into People's Square on Thursday and by nightfall the crowd swelled past 10,000, many carrying candles, witnesses said by telephone.\n",
      "In the absence of a Deng portrait, people gathered round a statue of China's revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.\n",
      "\"For us here it's tumultuous,\" a worker at a hotel on the square told Reuters. \"Not only in Chengdu but all across Sichuan province, it's tumultuous.\"\n",
      "The crowds thinned on Friday and Saturday, but officials were tolerating the square's use as a centre for mourning and many people were weeping openly over Deng's death. Many came on outings organised by their work units.\n",
      "\"There are several hundred police, traffic police and People's Armed Police to maintain order and prevent people getting hurt,\" the hotel worker said.\n",
      "In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong that was Deng's earliest reform brainchild, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine.\n",
      "The billboard stands in a square beside one of Deng's most stunning innovations, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which Deng said proved that markets were acceptable not only in capitalist societies but also under socialism.\n",
      "Mourners placed wreaths of white and yellow chrysanthemums below the billboard, some draped with white streamers bearing Deng's reformist slogans or newspaper clippings about a 1992 visit Deng made to Shenzhen to jumpstart his stalling reforms.\n",
      "\"We wish you heavenly peace,\" read one streamer. Said another: \"Thank you for the reform and opening up.\"\n",
      "\"There's no public organised mourning of Deng, but I think this is better because people who come to mourn for Deng do it from the bottom of their hearts,\" said a policeman named Chen.\n",
      "At Shenzhen's botanical garden, someone had hung a black and white portrait of Deng from a banyan tree that Deng planted in 1992. Scores of people burned incense and bowed three times in the traditional Chinese form of mourning.\n",
      "\"Uncle Deng, we miss you!\" wailed a kneeling man surnamed Jin who had brought his year-old child. \"Come child, pay your respect to Uncle Deng.\"\n",
      "\"I was shattered by the news of his death,\" Jin said later. \"He has done simply too much for us. I can find no words to express my grief and can only repay him by working harder.\"\n",

      "China's offer to return a hijacker to Taiwan has raised hopes of an easing of tension between the two rivals but it is likely to be only a small step in closing their wide gulf, analysts said on Thursday.\n",
      "They said Beijing has allowed itself flexibility by not saying when it would return the unemployed journalist who is alleged to have commandeered a Taiwan airliner 10 days ago.\n",
      "Taiwan, which holds the trump cards in this round of their diplomatic game, may also be trying to use the issue to force a resumption of formal talks with China, broken off in mid-1995.\n",
      "\"It's an interesting and encouraging development in that they are still talking to each other on practical matters,\" said a Western diplomat with long years of China experience.\n",
      "\"But it's no major concession,\" he said. \"There's likely to be more people hijacking in the opposite direction.\"\n",
      "China on Thursday gave in to Taiwan's demands to repatriate Liu Shan-chung, but demanded the island send back 16 Chinese hijackers in return.\n",
      "It did not give a date for the return of Liu, who is suspected of forcing a Taiwanese airliner to fly to China's southeastern city of Xiamen. The plane, crew and all other passengers were returned the same day but China has held the hijacker in custody.\n",
      "\"Liu Shan-chung... will be repatriated to Taiwan after necessary investigations are made,\" the official Xinhua news agency said, quoting China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.\n",
      "The semi-official association handles bilateral ties in the absence of formal links between Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile on Taiwan in 1949.\n",
      "The association said China was repatriating the hijacker in line with an agreement reached in 1990, but which was never signed.\n",
      "Taiwan has jailed 16 Chinese for hijacking 12 airliners to the island between April 1993 and June 1994. It has offered to return two of them.\n",
      "\"Beijing is more eager to see an end to hijackings,\" said another diplomat in Beijing. \"That gives Taiwan leverage on this issue.\"\n",
      "Taiwan welcomed Beijing's announcement but declined to signal any further response.\n",
      "\"This will be positive for our future talks on hijacker repatriation,\" said Jonathan Liu, a director of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council.\n",
      "But he said Taiwan would wait for formal notification before it decided on its next move.\n",
      "Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping with China for almost five decades, and insists such links must go through a third territory, mainly Hong Kong.\n",
      "China has been pushing for direct trade and transport links though Taiwan has been using these as key bargaining chips on any talks on the future relations of the two rivals.\n",
      "Taipei wants to see a resumption of semi-official talks, broken off by China after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui made a private visit to the United States in 1995. The visit angered China, which views the island as a renegade province that is not entitled to official contacts with other states.\n",
      "Foreign analysts in Beijing said that the timing of the announcement on Liu's return to Taiwan had some additional political mileage for Beijing.\n",
      "It was made shortly before the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, starts a visit to the island.\n",

      "With just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong, Beijing has sidestepped the colony's departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue.\n",
      "China has made clear its intention to mould the territory's politics more in its own image, mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless.\n",
      "\"China is firmly in charge,\" said a Beijing-based diplomat.\n",
      "Chinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London's hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover, proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit.\n",
      "\"I think this is unrealistic,\" Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact's implementation after the transfer of power. \"After July 1, Hong Kong's sovereignty returns to China.\"\n",
      "Under the 1984 accord, China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.\n",
      "Beijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp.\n",
      "Since his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China's official party line.\n",

      "The shipping tycoon-turned-politician, who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December, has echoed China's views on issues ranging from the territory's future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions.\n",
      "He has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China.\n",
      "Beijing has responded by showing its pleasure.\n",
      "The official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory's current and last colonial governor, Chris Patten, who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule.\n",
      "In a sign of official favour, cameras of China's national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"Mr Tung knows that if he doesn't carry out Beijing's wishes, someone else will,\" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.\n",
      "Other analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung.\n",
      "\"He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese,\" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs.\n",
      "WILL TUNG STAND UP FOR HONG KONG?\n",
      "\"The question is, will he stand up for Hong Kong's interests in the future?\"\n",
      "Some people are not so sure.\n",
      "\"That is the charitable assessment,\" said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong.\n",
      "He and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong's business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public, whatever the issue.\n",
      "The analysts note opposition can be costly.\n",
      "Jardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading houses, was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten. It has since worked hard to mend its relationship.\n",

      "Many businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing's ears, such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, on the contribution of China's late leader Deng Xiaoping.\n",
      "An article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, praised the late party patriarch, his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong, all making deft use of communist jargon.\n",
      "But diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung, there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing.\n",
      "China wants a popular leader who can rally the territory's 6.4 million people to Beijing's cause, they said.\n",
      "If its interests clash with those of Hong Kong, and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing's willing tool, the future leader risks losing his still high popular support.\n",
      "\"China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding,\" said a diplomat. \"If he loses popularity in Hong Kong, that complicates matters for Beijing.\"\n",

      "\"We cannot accept Patten's so-called statement,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said, referring to the governor's criticism of plans to abolish laws on democratic elections and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the transfer of power this year.\n",
      "\"I want to remind the British authorities in Hong Kong that the government of China today is not the pre-1949 government,\" he told reporters, referring to the year of the Communist revolution.\n",
      "\"We cannot accept any instances of others trying to impose their will on us.\"\n",
      "Patten had condemned a move by a China-appointed panel, known as the Preparatory Committee, to draw up a list of 25 laws and articles for repeal or amendment after the transfer of power at midnight on June 30.\n",
      "After the handover, the territory that has been a British colony for more than 150 years will become a Special Administrative Region of China.\n",
      "The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Preparatory Committee had the authority to review existing Hong Kong laws to determine whether they were in conflict with the Basic Law, a mini-constitution drafted by China for the territory.\n",
      "\"This is entirely an internal matter for China,\" he said.\n",
      "Shen also tried to play down the impact of the proposals, saying there basically would be no change to existing laws.\n",
      "He called on the Hong Kong government to avoid making statements that \"misled the public or undermined morale in the territory\".\n",
      "Patten had said the proposals, made at a committee meeting in Beijing on Sunday, struck at the heart of Hong Kong's civil liberties and appeared to be politically motivated rather than reflecting real inconsistencies with the Basic Law.\n",
      "Among the laws to be diluted are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law, the Societies Ordinance which permits the formation of political parties and a 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.\n",
      "\"Those laws which conflict with the Basic Law cannot continue as laws of the Special Administrative Region,\" Shen said.\n",
      "He said that if the Preparatory Committee recommended the revision or abolition of these laws, it was reasonable and in the interests of a smooth transfer of power.\n",

      "\"We must seek to reduce the rate of bad loans by two percent annually over the next few years,\" he said. \"We will hold accountable the leaders of those banks that cannot meet the standards.\"\n",

      "He has ordered banks to divorce themselves from trust company subsidiaries that can invest in more speculative markets.\n",

      "\"Airbus will be disappointed at today's order,\" said a another Western diplomat.\n",
      "\"They were looking to sell the A330-300,\" a twin-engine jet that Airbus says it has not yet sold in China.\n",

      "Analysts said they would watch closely to see whether new plane orders go to Airbus Industrie and how many planes were purchased.\n",
      "China has said it will put in service some 240 more planes during the current five-year plan ending in the year 2000 to keep up with rising demand for domestic and international air travel. Most of those planes have yet to be ordered.\n",
      "Boeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus.\n",
      "But Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights.\n",
      "Airbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion.\n",
      "Those planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets.\n",
      "Boeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion.\n",

      "Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.\n",

      "\"Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,\" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.\n",
      "\"Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,\" he said.\n",
      "The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.\n",
      "Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.\n",
      "The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months. The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose \"discriminatory\" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.\n",
      "Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n",

      "\"Most people believe that a speculative bubble emerged (in the nation's stock markets) at the end of last year,\" it said.\n",
      "It blamed this on a diversion of funds from the banking system into the stock market, and added that it was clear this had involved institutional money.\n",
      "Beijing moved to cool off the heated stock market speculation -- which had pushed one of the main indices up as much as 360 percent -- by warning investors that what goes up must come down, and reminding them that the state would not step in to bail them out.\n",
      "China also has been trying to keep its state-run banks from fuelling stock market speculation, first by severing their ties to trust companies -- which can put funds in the stock market -- and by making it harder for them to finance stock speculation.\n",

      "One explosion occurred on Northwest Road, involving a vehicle believed to be a minibus, a worker at a nearby hotel said.\n",
      "Asked if anyone was killed, the worker said: \"What do you think? With many people on the bus the chance is very high.\"\n",
      "Nearby residents contacted by telephone said traffic was snarled along the road for about one hour and that people were being advised to avoid the area.\n",

      "The key objective for the two sides was to ensure they moved closer to the goal of an exchange of presidential visits, putting the final seal on efforts to repair damaged relations.\n",
      "\"Gore's visit took them one step closer to that goal,\" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing.\n",
      "Gore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin, telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates.\n",
      "The United States and China have been moving painstakingly to ease strains over disputes ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.\n",
      "Gore, the most senior U.S. official in Beijing since the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said his talks with Chinese leaders last week touched on the key areas of disagreement but he described China's reaction as milder than in the past.\n",
      "While the speaker of the House of Representatives had somewhat tougher talk in public for his Chinese hosts, pointedly referring to Beijing's policies on human rights and Taiwan, the content was not unexpected.\n",
      "\"He is a bit less constrained in what he can say,\" said a Chinese journalist who covers foreign affairs. \"China recognises this.\"\n",
      "More importantly for China's leaders, the visit by the key Republican and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation presented an opportunity for Beijing to make a personal pitch on major issues such as Taiwan.\n",
      "Jiang used his meeting with Gingrich on Friday to note how pleased he was that more congressmen were visiting China to see first hand the importance of the Taiwan issue to Beijing.\n",
      "China and Taiwan, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, are vying for the sympathies of American policymakers and the public.\n",
      "The United States recognises China but has strong commercial and other unofficial ties with the island that Beijing views as a renegade province.\n",
      "Beijing believes it was misled by Washington over the landmark 1995 visit to the U.S. by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. The administration assured Beijing that no visit would be permitted but the trip was allowed to proceed under pressure from Congress.\n",
      "Both Washington and Beijing struggled to ensure that accusations of illegal Chinese funding for the Democratic Party did not overshadow the Gore visit.\n",
      "Gore reassured Beijing that unless there was firm evidence of illegal payments, the issue would not affect U.S. policy.\n",
      "The visit also underscored Washington's hopes that no one issue be allowed to dominate the Sino-U.S. relationship.\n",
      "\"Trade issues as well as human rights will all remain on the table for discussion in the future,\" said another diplomat. If there was any one area where specific progress could be expected soon, perhaps it was trade, another diplomat said.\n",
      "American figures put the U.S. trade deficit with China at about $40 billion last year, and Washington has been pushing for greater access to the China market to narrow the gap.\n",

      "\"The issue has become such a general concern to American people from all walks of life that failure to handle the issue properly could hold up the normal development of the economic and trade relations between the two countries,\" Sun said in a statement given to reporters.\n",
      "The statement was one of the most visible signs that Beijing policymakers were looking for ways to head off possible U.S. measures to curb China's sales to that market.\n",
      "Sun expressed hope that the visit next week by U.S. Vice President Al Gore would help develop mutual trust, and he hinted the trip might coincide with the signing of some major contracts.\n",
      "\"I would not exclude the possibility of the signing of some contracts,\" he told reporters.\n",

      "He made his remarks one day after Washington announced China's trade surplus with the United States rose to $3.72 billion in January from $2.74 billion in January last year.\n",
      "Washington says China had a surplus of nearly $40 billion with the United States for all of last year while Beijing puts the figure at $10 billion.\n",
      "China does not count shipments through Hong Kong and the White Paper addressed this issue by saying that both American and Chinese experts agreed those goods had an average of 40 percent added value in Hong Kong.\n",
      "That meant the U.S. version of the trade imbalance was overstated, according to the White Paper.\n",
      "The paper pointed out that much of the trade surplus was from China's processing of raw materials from other regions, meaning that other countries were in fact benefiting from the trade as well.\n",
      "China was also providing low-cost production that had been done in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the past, and was not taking jobs away from American workers.\n",
      "Sun said U.S. companies had lost out on major infrastructure contracts, particularly in the electric power sector, because of a lack of government export financing, and he called for more support from the U.S. Export-Import Bank.\n",
      "Washington had thwarted its own prospects in the nuclear power sector because of restrictions on nuclear technology exports to China.\n",
      "\"The U.S. export control policies and lingering sanctions against China have greatly restricted U.S. exports to China as well as U.S. investments in high-tech sectors,\" the White Paper said.\n",
      "Sun noted that China had reduced its import duties sharply in recent years and that further cuts would bring the average rate to 15 percent by the year 2000 from 23 percent now.\n",

      "The death of Deng Xiaoping has deprived China of the architect of reform but it has left his successor in charge of an economic powerhouse in its best shape in years, economists said on Friday.\n",
      "China has attained a track record that many countries would envy -- strong economic growth, inflation in check, mounting foreign exchange reserves and a stable currency.\n",
      "\"I am optimistic on the economy,\" said Lin Qingsong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank.\n",
      "\"Overall, we are in a very good situation economically.\"\n",

      "\"It sounds awful, but Deng couldn't have died at a better time,\" said a Western economist.\n",

      "Deng died on Wednesday aged 92, leaving his hand-picked successor President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin in charge of this nation of 1.2 billion people.\n",
      "It was Deng who helped steer China on its current economic course, wrenching it from purist Marxist policies that had brought the nation to the brink of starvation and industrial collapse in 1960.\n",
      "The Deng reforms, adopted in 1978, allowed private enterprise and relied on market forces instead of Stalinist central planning.\n",
      "Eventually, the scope of change became even more sweeping, embracing stock and futures markets and breeding a new generation of \"red capitalists\" known for their millionaire lifestyles.\n",
      "China chalked up economic growth of 9.7 percent last year as it held its once troublesome inflation rate to a shade over 6 percent, well below target and down sharply from more than 14 percent in 1995.\n",
      "The nation has become a magnet for foreign investment, with many of the West's biggest corporations queuing up in the search for a share of this rapidly expanding market. In the process, China has amassed foreign currency reserves of $105 billion.\n",
      "Economists said remnants of the centrally planned economy still needed overhauling before communist leaders could rest easy.\n",
      "\"There are still many economic issues to be addressed and one of them is the state sector,\" said Lin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",
      "\"State companies need fundamental change.\"\n",
      "While many of China's private and foreign-invested companies are chalking up profits, an inefficient state sector has been unable to match those results.\n",
      "About 75 percent of China's more than 100,000 state firms lost money last year. Total losses in the state sector were up 45 percent to 69 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) in the first 10 months of last year.\n",
      "Economists said state enterprises were grossly overstaffed and needed to trim bloated payrolls while some companies would never make money and would have to be shut.\n",
      "But layoffs and bankruptcies are seen as a threat to stability and Beijing is moving ahead cautiously on this issue.\n",
      "Before surplus workers can be told to find new jobs there must be a real social safety net in a country that has neither a national pension scheme nor unemployment insurance.\n",
      "Other economists said reforms were unlikely to gather pace in the months ahead as Jiang Zemin and other communist leaders look ahead to a key party congress scheduled for later this year. The meeting will make top personnel changes and chart policies for the next five years.\n",
      "But economic analysts said China now has enough of an economic cushion that it can take its time and examine further reform carefully.\n",

      "However, it stopped short of spelling out what action it would take over the islands -- claimed by Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei -- adding that it would exercise restraint.\n",
      "\"Japan should recognise the seriousness of the matter and take actions to stop these...illegal activities,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.\n",
      "\"If Japan continues to encourage them the situation will be even more serious,\" he said of the right-wing activists. \"The ball is in Japan's court.\"\n",
      "A long-dormant dispute over the islands, called the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus by Japan, erupted in July after the right-wing Japan Youth Federation erected a lighthouse on one of the islets.\n",
      "Friction mounted earlier this month after Japanese coast-guard ships barred private Taiwan boats from reaching the area while the rightist group repaired the typhoon-damaged structure.\n",
      "Beijing and Taipei have assailed Japan's protection of the rightists' activities and ordered Tokyo to keep people away from the islands that lie east of China's southeastern Fujian coast, west of Japan's Okinawa island and northeast of Taiwan.\n",
      "Chinese in the British colony of Hong Kong have also closed ranks, ignoring other political disputes and voicing support for Beijing's claim to the islands.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in the charge d'affaires in Beijing, warning of serious damage to ties if Japan failed to stop right-wingers from setting foot on the islands.\n",

      "Exiled ethnic Uighurs, who want to set up an independent state of \"East Turkestan\" in Xinjiang, have claimed responsibility for the bombings and vowed to stage more attacks until they had gained complete freedom for their homeland.\n",

      "\"The U.S. wants to ensure that its China relations are no longer scraping along the bottom,\" said a Western diplomat.\n",
      "U.S.-China ties had stumbled badly over a range of issues including Taiwan, trade, arms proliferation and human rights.\n",
      "A long-delayed visit to Beijing in November by Albright's predecessor Warren Christopher paved the way for the renewed push to put differences aside.\n",
      "That new approach was endorsed at a meeting between Jiang and Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila later that month.\n",
      "U.S. Vice President Al Gore will travel to China next month and Clinton and Jiang are expected to exchange visits over the next year.\n",
      "Albright may be compelled to touch on human rights during her talks with Chinese officials as the United States plans to co-sponsor a resolution critical of China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.\n",
      "Washington may also be looking to show at least some measure of toughness towards Beijing to allay domestic concerns following allegations of Chinese contributions to Clinton's re-election campaign.\n",
      "But Albright and other U.S. officials have said no one issue should dominate the relationship.\n",
      "Analysts said that probably means that as for the more difficult problems, the two sides will have to agree to disagree.\n",

      "China marked on Saturday the first \"tombsweeping\" day since the death of Deng Xiaoping with few outward signs of remembrance for the late paramount leader.\n",
      "Thousands of Beijing residents streamed through the gates of Babaoshan cemetery for the Qingming festival, traditionally the day for tidying ancestral graves.\n",
      "But for the most part this was a family occasion, far removed from the political limelight that surrounded Deng during his lifetime.\n",
      "\"I have come here every year since my husband died in 1991,\" said a Beijing resident, holding the hand of her granddaughter as they left the cemetery.\n",
      "\"This is a family matter. There is no connection with any political leaders.\"\n",
      "A group of students from Deng's native province of Sichuan, all of them enrolled at a university in the Chinese capital, gathered at the cemetery gates. They too had a private reason for being there.\n",
      "\"We are helping a friend sweep his father's grave,\" said one of the students.\n",
      "Deng died on February 19 aged 92. He was cremated at Babaoshan and his ashes scattered at sea in accordance with his wishes.\n",
      "That has left the public with no specific place to honour the man who steered China away from the radical policies of Mao Zedong and onto the path of economic development, even if it meant adopting capitalist ways.\n",
      "Those pragmatic policies raised living standards and turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.\n",
      "Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been one such place to honour the nation's fallen heroes but public displays of respect were not encouraged on this day.\n",
      "Early on Saturday, as a group of secondary students walked towards the shrine to martyrs of the revolution at the centre of the square, they were quickly approached by security men.\n",
      "After a brief discussion, they were allowed to bow and then told to leave, witnesses said.\n",
      "China's communist leaders have traditionally planted trees on the Qingming festival and that was how the official media chose to remember Deng.\n",
      "The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, showed photographs of Deng planting trees over the years since 1979, when he began his programme of reforms that changed China's political landscape.\n",
      "\"Now these trees have grown tall,\" said the newspaper.\n",
      "In the spirit of Deng's reforms, vendors of silk flowers were doing brisk business outside the Babaoshan cemetery.\n",
      "Visitors queued up to buy wreaths similar to those that adorned grave sites inside.\n",
      "Deng was in the thoughts of other Beijing residents, such as Bai Lansheng, a sculptor who is working on a bronze statue of the late leader.\n",
      "\"We are getting ready to ship the plaster mould to Shanghai now,\" he said from his Beijing workshop. \"There it will be cast in bronze.\"\n",
      "In June the six-metre (20-foot) statue will be shipped to the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders the British colony of Hong Kong.\n",
      "Deng directed negotiations that led to the 1984 Sino-British accord under which the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.\n",
      "Deng died before the colony's recovery but his statue will gaze across the border and \"witness\" the historic event.\n",

      "U.S. Vice President Al Gore arrived in Beijing on Monday to heal Sino-U.S. ties and pave the way for an exchange of presidential visits amid controversy about possible Chinese efforts to influence U.S. elections.\n",
      "Gore told reporters before he left Tokyo for Beijing that he would not shy away from issues such as human rights in talks with Chinese leaders during his four-day visit, but had no plans for specific meetings with human rights activists.\n",
      "Speaking after a 24-hour stay in Tokyo Gore said, however, that he could not rule out talks with activists at U.S. embassy functions while he was in China.\n",
      "The controversy over U.S. accusations that China may have made illegal contributions to the Democratic Party cast a cloud over the four-day visit aimed at healing ties damaged by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.\n",
      "The official People's Daily said on Monday the Chinese government had not made any payments to the Democratic Party and that an improvement in Sino-U.S. ties was due to efforts by the two governments and their people.\n",
      "Asked what U.S. concerns he would raise in Beijing, Gore replied: \"I will, of course, discuss human rights in my meetings with the leadership of China, nor will it be a surprise to them to hear these matters raised.\"\n",
      "But he added: \"I have no specific meeting of that kind (planned with human rights activists).\"\n",
      "Human rights abuses in China have long been a sore spot in Sino-U.S. relations, particularly since China called in the army to crush a student-led democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.\n",
      "Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then President George Bush, who toured China just months before the 1989 crackdown that sent Sino-U.S. ties into a tailspin.\n",
      "In its annual report on human rights, the U.S. State Department accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.\n",
      "Sino-U.S. relations had been strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan, but Washington and Beijing have worked hard to improve ties in recent months.\n",
      "Gore's trip to China, part of an Asian tour that includes South Korea, is aimed at paving the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin over the next year.\n",
      "The sister of China's most prominent dissident has appealed to Gore to ask Beijing to free him from a 14-year jail term when he meets China's leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n",
      "The health of veteran dissident Wei Jingsheng was deteriorating in a Chinese jail and his requests for medical care had been ignored by prison authorities, a U.S.-based human rights group quoted his family as saying after a recent visit.\n",
      "In a letter to Gore, Wei's sister called on the U.S. vice president to use the opportunity of his meetings this week with Chinese leaders to appeal for the release of her brother.\n",
      "\"I ask you to appeal to the Chinese government for my brother's prompt release and, until prior to his release, for his parole for medical treatment,\" wrote Wei Shanshan in a letter dated March 4, a copy of which was made available by the New York-based group Human Rights in China.\n",
      "Although U.S. officials were negotiating with their Chinese counterparts to try to hammer out various agreements in time for Gore's trip, no dramatic breakthroughs are expected.\n",
      "In fact, Gore's advisers had a debate over whether he should even participate in a signing ceremony in which China plans to order new aircraft from Boeing Co, a move that will generate jobs and benefit the U.S. economy.\n",
      "Although officials said there was no doubt Gore would participate in such an event if a final contract was reached, the fact there was any question underscored the sensitivity of the political funding issue.\n",

      "China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.\n",
      "Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.\n",
      "They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.\n",
      "\"Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,\" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.\n",
      "\"Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,\" he said.\n",
      "The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.\n",
      "Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.\n",
      "The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months.\n",
      "The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose \"discriminatory\" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.\n",
      "Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n",
      "Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.\n",
      "Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.\n",

      "China's angry attack, carried by the official Xinhua news agency and titled: \"A Look at the U.S. Human Rights Record\", also said American-style political democracy was a game of the rich and faulted the U.S. constitution for providing inadequate guarantees.\n",

      "\"The U.S. government, posing as the 'human rights judge of the world', turned a blind eye yet again to the serious human rights problems in its own country,\" Xinhua said.\n",
      "\"There are 220 million firearms in private hands, which translates into nearly one gun per person,\" it said. \"Armed criminals are on the rampage, shootings are non-stop and a large number of innocent people have fallen prey to violence.\"\n",
      "Xinhua cited the deadly 1993 World Trade Centre bombing in New York, the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City and the explosion during the Olympic Games in Atlanta last year as symptoms of America's deep-rooted problems.\n",
      "\"It is not accidental that terrorist bomb attacks continuously occur in the United States, an excessively violent country where terrorism is deeply rooted in society.\"\n",
      "The news agency said the United States had one of the world's largest police forces relative to its population and the largest prison population.\n",

      "China's state-run steel companies must trim their bloated payrolls but they are nimble enough to survive in the fiercely competitive marketplace, top officials said on Monday.\n",
      "They also pledged that big steelmakers now preparing to float their shares -- like Anshan Steel and Chongqing Iron and Steel -- would not disappoint shareholders.\n",
      "\"We have confidence in the state enterprises in our industry,\" said Liu Qi, minister of Metallurgial Industry. \"They can adapt to market conditions.\"\n",
      "Liu and other senior ministry officials told reporters that many companies in the sector had already begun trimming staff and the trend would continue in the years ahead.\n",
      "\"We have made a good start to restructuring,\" he said, adding that reforms would continue.\n",
      "Many of China's big state industries are grossly overstaffed and unable to compete with more efficient foreign competitors.\n",
      "Senior ministry officials said they wanted to see only about 800,000 workers producing steel by the turn of the century. The industry employs 4.5 million people now, but that includes many workers not directly engaged in production as well as those at associated companies.\n",
      "Liu said that Anshan Steel, one of three companies cleared late last year to list its shares abroad, had 190,000 employees but only 70,000 were producing steel.\n",
      "The others were at affiliated companies that were operating independently, he said.\n",
      "Liu cautioned, however, that many of them would not be out on the street as companies would try to find some form of work for them.\n",
      "\"Restructuring does not mean large numbers of people thrown out of work,\" he said.\n",
      "Liu said that while steelmakers tried to streamline their operations they were also incorporating new technology to help cut production costs.\n",
      "Other officials defended the track record of steel companies that have already offered shares, such as Hong Kong-listed Maanshan Iron and Steel, which has struggled with profits.\n",
      "\"Maanshan is a good company with excellent products and equipment,\" said vice minister Wang Wanbin.\n",
      "\"Maanshan has had problems but it will achieve better results in future,\" he said, adding that other steelmakers would also perform well in future.\n",
      "Other officials said that China's had 107 large and medium-sized steel making companies and that 70 percent of them made were profitable last year.\n",
      "They earned a net 5.1 billion yuan last year with gross profits of 7.4 billion yuan, partly offset by losses of 2.3 billion from those operating in the red.\n",
      "They added that nearly half of the smaller companies were losing money though and that economies of scale had to be raised.\n",

      "The bomb went off on a Number 22 bus as it trundled through Beijing's western Xidan district during the evening rush hour. China's state-controlled media have said no one died but sources said the blast killed at least two people and injured 30.\n",
      "The semi-official China News Service quoted Beijing Mayor Jia Qingling as saying another smaller bomb went off earlier last week elsewhere in the Chinese capital. No one was hurt in that incident.\n",

      "\"Stable development is more important than a big profit rise,\" said Zhang Jian, deputy general manager and economist.\n",
      "The bank has set a target of pre-tax profits of at least 1.8 billion yuan ($217 million) this year compared with 1.58 billion in 1996 and 1.01 billion in 1995.\n",
      "The bank is a major profit contributor to the China International Trust and Development Corp, or CITIC, which has interests from telecommunications to real estate and manufacturing. The CITIC group announced overall earnings of 2.478 billion yuan last year.\n",
      "China's economic tsar Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has pushed for more discipline in the financial sector, particularly following the failure in January of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp. That sent shock waves through the financial community, and Zhu has warned that state banks overall need to cut bad debt by two percent annually over the next five years.\n",
      "CITIC Industrial Bank has been one of the stronger players in the financial sector, however.\n",
      "Unlike the main state-run commercial banks, it does not have to make loans to aid government policy, regardless of whether the borrower can repay.\n",
      "But Zhang said top management at the bank was focusing on tightening risk controls.\n",
      "\"Enhancing (asset) quality and the assessment of risk\" were two key goals for the bank this year, he said in an interview.\n",
      "CITIC's customers for the most part were profitable state industrial companies and government corporations engaged in foreign trade. Most of the bank's loans were short term, usually for less than 180 days, Zhang said.\n",
      "That has made it difficult for the bank to move into new areas of business such as home mortgages or car financing, two areas where China is likely to see substantial growth in the years ahead.\n",
      "CITIC is also facing an increasingly crowded banking sector as new domestic banks emerge and more foreign banks enter the local market.\n",
      "Zhang said CITIC had begun private banking operations at its branch in the southern city of Guangzhou to try to expand business.\n",
      "It is experimenting with ways to boost service to its big corporate clients, such as extending banking hours and installing computers at customer offices and linking them to its own network to make banking easier.\n",

      "Deposits reached 87 billion yuan last year, up from 67 billion in 1995, despite two reductions in domestic interest rates by the central bank last year.\n",
      "Zhang said he believed further cuts in interest rates would make it difficult for the nation's banks to attract deposits.\n",

      "Woodard told reporters both sides had reached basic agreement a year ago, but signing faced lengthy delays because of political differences between China and the United States.\n",
      "\"There is no doubt the contract was not executed when it was ready because of tension between the U.S. and China last year and the year before,\" he told reporters at a news briefing after the ceremony.\n",
      "\"There are times when politics are involved,\" he said.\n",
      "A year ago, China and the United States were at odds over a range of issues from trade and human rights to Beijing's sabre-rattling over Taiwan.\n",
      "Chinese Premier Li Peng was also on hand when Beijing turned to the European consortium Airbus Industrie in April last year, buying 30 airliners in a $1.5 billion deal.\n",

      "Boeing officials said they hoped the United States would take further steps to keep the relationship healthy.\n",
      "\"We strongly and fully support granting China permanent Most Favoured Nation status and China's accession to the World Trade Organisation. Both are critical to achieving normalised world trade,\" Woodard said.\n",

      "It has also pushed for entry into the global trade body, but Washington has insisted that Beijing agree to liberalise more of its trade policies first.\n",
      "Boeing walked away from the latest contract signing ceremony with a bit less than it wanted.\n",

      "China is expected to unveil a cautious budget this weekend, avoiding bold but risky moves in 1997, the crucial year of the recovery of Hong Kong and a major meeting of the Communist Party elite, economists said on Friday.\n",
      "The 1997 budget would again show a hefty deficit although it could be smaller than the 61.442 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) estimate for 1996, they said.\n",
      "\"This should be a year for a steady-as-she-goes budget,\" said a foreign diplomat who follows economic issues.\n",
      "Finance Minister Liu Zhongli is expected to announce the budget to the National People's Congress, or parliament, on Sunday or Monday.\n",
      "The recovery of the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the scheduling of the Communist Party congress for later in the year will most likely ensure cautious fiscal policies, economists said.\n",
      "Beijing wants to see the Hong Kong handover proceed smoothly and its leaders have little inclination to take risks ahead of the congress which will set policies and decide who gets the top jobs for the next five years. Beijing's leaders also have an added reason for caution as they can no longer rely on the steadying hand of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died this month.\n",
      "\"I am not looking for anything startling in the budget,\" said another foreign diplomat.\n",
      "Even if the deficit is not reduced this year, it will still be manageable. Last year's deficit was only 0.99 percent of estimated 1996 gross domestic product.\n",
      "Economists said they expected to see higher tax revenues this year as China's economy grows at a steady pace and tax collection improves.\n",
      "China has already forecast economic growth of 10.5 percent for the year, up from 9.7 percent recorded in 1996. Premier Li Peng on Saturday is to set a yet more cautious goal of 8.0 percent growth.\n",
      "State revenues expanded 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, and economists said more efficient tax collection and better management of state finances were key factors.\n",
      "Inflation will also be relatively modest this year, limiting upward pressure on government spending. Retail price inflation is forecast at less than the 6.1 percent of 1996.\n",
      "Despite lower interest rates, Beijing will need to meet increased payments of interest and principal on past debts, said economist Li Yang, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n",
      "\"This will mean more bonds will be issued this year,\" he said.\n",
      "Economists said, however, this was not a major concern as it was largely in line with China's efforts to issue more tradeable debt to create an active secondary market and strengthen its financial sector.\n",
      "But a cautious budget will mean China cannot afford to make deep cuts in subsidies to ailing state industry in 1997.\n",
      "Many overstaffed state companies badly need to shed workers from their payrolls but Beijing's leaders are fearful this could lead to social unrest.\n",
      "Economists will also be watching the military budget closely, where further increases in spending are expected.\n",
      "Deng's chosen successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, needs the support of the army to retain his grip on power.\n",
      "In his eulogy for Deng, Jiang referred to the army as the \"pillar of the state\".\n",
      "China has said it wants to reduce the size of its three-million-strong army but it is likely to more than offset savings with stepped up spending on advanced weaponry, analysts said.\n",
